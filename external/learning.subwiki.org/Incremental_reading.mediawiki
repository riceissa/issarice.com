'''Incremental reading''' is a technique for reading articles and learning/retaining information.

Incremental reading seems to combine several techniques into a package:

* It uses the regular spaced repetition suite of techniques ([[spaced repetition]], [[active recall]], especially [[cloze deletion]]s)
* It mixes learning of new material with review of old material (in particular, one encounters completely new material during incremental reading, unlike a regular spaced repetition flashcard program where each card must be created individually). In other words, the [[temporal pacing]] controls both the pacing of new material and of the review.
* Probably some sort of [[interleaving]] where learning/review of different subjects are combined in a single session.
* Possibly some sort of prioritization process that controls the temporal pacing between subjects.

==Goal/sales pitch==


* How does this technique improve learning, retention, or [[illusion of transparency|transparency]]?
* Why would one expect this technique to work at all?

==User==

This technique is used by the [[learner]].

==Requirements/genericity==

* Under what learning conditions can this be applied? For what kind of students?
* What kinds of material are required?

Some sort of spaced repetition software

==Training==

===Scope for improvement===

Basically: how big is the difference between the gains a novice can expect, versus the gains a master of this technique can expect?

==Software==

[[SuperMemo]] seems to have the most complete implementation of incremental reading, but there is a plugin for [[Anki]] that implements some of the features of incremental reading.

==Evidence==

* studies, data, anecdotes, opinion pieces
