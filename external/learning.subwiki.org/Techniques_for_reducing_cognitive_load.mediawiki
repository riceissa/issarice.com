This page lists learning techniques for reducing cognitive load.

* [[Worked-example effect]]
* [[Spaced repetition]] (kind of, especially when used in a specific way; see [http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html] for some ideas)
* Related to the previous point, but spending a lot of time with the "basic conceptual building blocks" for an idea before moving on to the idea itself, i.e. making sure you understand the prerequisites well.
* In math, various ways of justifying steps differ in terms of cognitive load:
** Having a string of equalities like A=B=C=D and saying "where the first equality follows from ..., the second follows from ..."
** A format like:
::: A = B (justification 1)
:::: = C (justification 2)
:::: = D (justification 3)
** Tabular proofs with a justification column
