What do I mean by a working model? Setting the context:

* If a subject wiki was a SQL database, what would be the tables and what would be columns in each table?
* If a subject wiki was an object-oriented program, what would be the classes, and what fields would those classes have?

==Learning technique==

===Sections===

* Goal/sales pitch: How does this technique improve learning, retention, or [[illusion of transparency|transparency]]? What problem encountered in learning does this technique address? Why would one expect this technique to work at all? What is the proposed mechanism (at a kind of Mickey Mouse cognitive algorithm level)?
* Examples: examples of this technique in use
* User: Does the [[learner]] or [[explainer]] use this technique?
* Requirements/generality
** Conditions: Under what learning conditions can this be applied?
** Material: What kinds of material are required? Does any software exist to make this technique particularly easy to implement?
** Interactions with other techniques
* Implementation/training
** Scope for improvement
** Variations on the technique
* Evidence and assessment: studies, data, anecdotes, opinion pieces, and advantages/disadvantages

==Ontology==

I'm not sure how to describe this type of page. But they seem to get at the basic ontology/background assumptions/concepts used when talking about learning. They aren't phenomena because I conceptualize phenomena as like laws you discover in the world. If a phenomenon is like a graph describing some effect, then the ontology is the axes of the graph.

===Examples===

* [[Retention]]
* [[Fade-out]]
* [[Learner]]
* [[Explainer]]
* [[Metacognition]]
* [[Temporal pacing]]
* [[Interactivity]]
* [[Transfer of learning]]
