This page classifies learning situations by the number of [[explainer]]s (e.g. teachers) and number of [[learner]]s (e.g. students) present. Each learning situation can be visualized as a directed graph where an arrow from <math>A</math> to <math>B</math> (<math>A \to B</math>) means "<math>A</math> explains to <math>B</math>".
