Here is an approach that uses the results of exercises in the book (assuming you are using the 2nd edition of the book). In exercise 3.12 you should have derived the equation $$v_\pi(s) = \sum_a \pi(a \mid s) q_\pi(s,a)$$ and in exercise 3.13 you should have derived the equation $$q_\pi(s,a) = \sum_{s',r} p(s',r\mid s,a)(r + \gamma v_\pi(s'))$$ Using these two equations, we can write $$\begin{align}v_\pi(s) &= \sum_a \pi(a \mid s) q_\pi(s,a) \\ &= \sum_a \pi(a \mid s) \sum_{s',r} p(s',r\mid s,a)(r + \gamma v_\pi(s'))\end{align}$$ which is the Bellman equation. Of course, this pushes most of the work into [exercise 3.13](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3143290/writing-action-value-function-in-terms-of-state-value-function-for-a-markov-deci) (but assuming you are reading/doing the exercise linearly, this shouldn't be a problem). Actually, it's a little strange that Sutton and Barto decided to go for the straight derivation (I guess they didn't want to give away the answers to the exercises).
