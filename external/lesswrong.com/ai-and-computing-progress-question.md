# Degree of duplication and coordination in projects that examine computing prices, AI progress, and related topics?

I have been noticing that an increasing number of organizations and researchers are looking into historical computing hardware prices, progress in AI systems, the relationship between hardware and AI progress, and related topics.

To list of these research efforts/outputs that I am aware of:

- [Open Philanthropy Project](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/new-staff-operations-programs-and-research#Kathleen_Finlinson_Research_Analyst): "One of my first projects was a study of how hardware advances have fed into artificial intelligence progress in the past decades. As a first step, I gathered historical data on computing hardware prices. This alone turned out to be much more difficult and complicated than anyone expected - which is one of the great lessons of research! Once the hardware data was roughly in place, I could compare it with historical AI progress. This requires estimating the level of “intelligence” of various AI systems, which is a qualitative and somewhat speculative task. My ongoing projects aim to put such estimates on a more empirical and quantitative footing."

I am curious to hear about the degree of overlap/duplication in this kind of work, and also the extent to which different groups are coordinating/talking to each other. In particular, I am potentially worried about a bunch of groups doing a lot of work "in-house" without coordination/sharing work, leading to duplicated effort (and correspondingly fewer insights). Another potential worry I have is if there are a bunch of scattered projects and no "clear winner", it is more difficult for outsiders to form an opinion.
