# Applications of causal inference to everyday life?

I've seen causal inference (specifically, the material in Judea Pearl's _Causality_) mentioned a bunch as a topic that has important implications and broad applications, and I've seen many people getting excited about it. To give some examples of previous discussion:

* Andrew Critch: ["Directed graphical models for our personal lives"](http://acritch.com/media/mphd/mphd-2012-02-08-causal-diagrams.pdf), ["Causal graphs for life problems and values"](http://acritch.com/media/mphd/causal-graphs-and-thinking-hats.pdf), ["What Causality Is (stats for mathematicians)"](http://www.acritch.com/media/math/critch-causality-talk-slides.pdf), ["Causality and Algebraic Geometry"](http://www.acritch.com/media/math/critch-slides-causality-and-algebraic-geometry.pdf)
* [GPI Workshop on Causal Inference and Extrapolation](https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/gpi-workshop-on-causal-inference-and-extrapolation/)
* Eliezer Yudkowsky: ["Causal Diagrams and Causal Models"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hzuSDMx7pd2uxFc5w/causal-diagrams-and-causal-models), ["Belief in Self-Deception"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wP2ymm44kZZwaFPYh/belief-in-self-deception) (probably more [here](https://www.greaterwrong.com/search?q=eliezer+yudkowsky+pearl))
* Peter McCluskey: note the presence of Pearl's _Causality_ on his [books page](http://bayesianinvestor.com/books.html)
* Michael Nielsen: ["If correlation doesn’t imply causation, then what does?"](http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/if-correlation-doesnt-imply-causation-then-what-does/), ["Guest post: Judea Pearl on correlation, causation and the psychology of Simpson’s paradox"](http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/guest-post-judea-pearl-on-correlation-causation-and-the-psychology-of-simpsons-paradox/), [tweet](https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1050248790958006272), ["Reinventing explanation"](http://michaelnielsen.org/reinventing_explanation/) (contains discussion of Simpson's paradox)
* gwern: ["Why Correlation Usually ≠ Causation: Causal Nets Cause Common Confounding"](https://www.gwern.net/Causality)
* Yan Zhang/Boris Alexeev: ["Defense Against the Dark Arts: the Reverse Regression Effect"](https://concretenonsense.wordpress.com/2013/02/16/defense-against-the-dark-arts-the-reverse-regression-effect/)
* Cosma Shalizi: see his [book](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/), [notebook](http://bactra.org/notebooks/causal-inference.html)

However, even after spending some time reading and thinking about this, I feel like I have little idea how to go about applying this to "everyday life". I'm not exactly sure what sort of applications I am imagining, but maybe things like (1) how to spot the presence of Simpson's paradox and resolve it; (2) how to draw a causal graph for a given situation and make decisions using it ("should I floss?"); (3) how to figure out which variables one would need to adjust for (e.g. figuring out if some empirical study did this correctly).

I can understand why causal inference is intellectually interesting, and I think if I spent a lot more time studying it, I could probably come up with good ways to apply it.

Maybe one way to phrase my question is to ask where on a spectrum of applicability (for mathematical subjects) causal inference lies, where the "most applicable" end is occupied by subjects like arithmetic, high school algebra, and calculus, and the "least applicable" end is occupied by a bunch of highly obscure topics in pure math.
