Some other sources of exercises you might want to check out (that have solutions and that I have used at least partly):

- [Multiple choice quizzes](http://scherk.pbworks.com/w/page/14864181/FrontPage) (the ones related to linear algebra are determinants, elementary matrices, inner product spaces, linear algebra, linear systems, linear transformations, matrices, and vector spaces)
- [Vipul Naik's quizzes](https://vipulnaik.com/math-196/) (disclosure: I am friends with Vipul and also do contract work for him)

Regarding Axler's book (since it has been mentioned in this thread): there are several "levels" of linear algebra, and Axler's book is at a higher level (emphasis on abstract vector spaces and coordinate-free ways of doing things) than the 3Blue1Brown videos (more concrete, working in $\mathbf R^n$). Axler's book also assumes that the reader has had exposure to the lower level material (e.g. he does not talk about row reduction and elementary matrices). So I'm not sure I would recommend it to someone starting out trying to learn the basics of linear algebra.

Gratuitous remarks:

- I think different resources covering material in a different order and using different terminology is in some sense a feature, not a bug, because it allows one to look at the subject from different perspectives. For instance, the "done right" in Axler's book comes from one such [change in perspective](http://www.axler.net/DwD.pdf).
- I find that learning mathematics well takes an [unintuitively long time](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CiFKhZq7A6cbBbMcj/learning-takes-a-long-time); it might be unrealistic to expect to learn the material well unless one puts in a lot of effort.
- I think there is a case to be made for the [importance of struggling in learning](https://learning.subwiki.org/wiki/Importance_of_struggling_in_learning) (disclosure: I am the author of the page).
