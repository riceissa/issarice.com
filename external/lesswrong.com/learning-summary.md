# My current thoughts on learning how to learn, educational psychology, spaced repetition, and all that

For the past two or so years, one of my side interests has been to figure out how effective learning works (especially with regard to highly technical and confusing topics such as math and AI safety), both as an autodidact myself and as someone who wants to produce clear written explanations. This post is a summary of my current take on this area.

The key takeaways are:

## History of my interest in the area

I first heard about spaced repetition sometime around 2011-2013, probably from LessWrong or gwern's website. I used Anki to memorize pretty random things, including Spanish vocabulary, English vocabulary, facts from history, literary techniques, random quotes, and kanji. Most of these things were related to my high school classes, and when I started college in 2014 it became clear that I didn't care about most of my decks. Even my non-school interests changed a bunch, which made my decks less useful. So I eventually stopped using Anki, probably sometime in 2014.

Around mid-2018, I began ramping up my self-study of math as part of my entry into AI safety. I realized how much of the math I had learned a couple of years ago I had forgotten, and resolved to figure out some way to make my forgetting less drastic and also to make my learning more effective in general. So I started using Anki again, and shortly after that Michael Nielsen's "[Augmenting Long-term Memory](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html)" was published, which influenced my thinking a lot.

Since mid-2018, I've continuously used Anki, playing around with it to see how to get the most out of it. I've also read a bunch of things related to learning in general.

## Inputs to my thinking

I want to list some of the main inputs to my thinking, so people can judge me on how I process evidence. Of course, even if you think I processed the evidence correctly, you might still think I sought out evidence in a biased way (and so disagree with my conclusions). I'm not aware of a way to convince people that I sought out evidence in a good way.

- Work by Michael Nielsen and Andy Matuschak, including [Quantum Country](https://quantum.country/) (all four essays plus reviews), ["Augmenting Long-term Memory"](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html), ["Using spaced repetition systems to see through a piece of mathematics"](http://cognitivemedium.com/srs-mathematics), ["Reinventing explanation"](http://michaelnielsen.org/reinventing_explanation/index.html), [Andy's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/), ["How can we develop transformative tools for thought?"](https://numinous.productions/ttft/), ["Toward an exploratory medium for mathematics"](http://cognitivemedium.com/emm/emm.html), and ["Magic Paper"](http://cognitivemedium.com/magic_paper/index.html): I think Michael and Andy have done the most to influence my views on learning, particularly by promoting to my attention the idea that Anki usage has a lot of [scope for improvement](https://learning.subwiki.org/wiki/Scope_for_improvement).
- gwern's [spaced repetition page](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition)
- The [Anki subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/): pretty low quality on average, but in some threads people share tips on how to make cards, and some of those things are somewhat useful.
- Dunlosky 2013 paper
- Richard Reitz, especially his [learning omega](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qu21SMy0DgQzYQBt1jCi416xeK6A-8eg84WA-kqamSM/edit) Google Doc.
- Lots of questions on Math Stack Exchange and Reddit about how to study math
- Lara Alcock's books about how to study math
- Cal Newport's _How to Become a Straight-A Student_
- Barbara Oakley's _A Mind For Numbers_
- Brown et al's _Make It Stick_
- Hans Freudenthal's writings about math education: I tried to understand what he was saying/what his main point is, but I never figured it out.
- ["Making Things Hard on Yourself, But in a Good Way: Creating Desirable Difficulties to Enhance Learning"](https://teaching.yale-nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2016/02/Making-Things-Hard-on-Yourself-but-in-a-Good-Way-2011.pdf)
- Piotr Wozniak, especially his [SuperMemo Guru](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru) wiki.
- The [Master How To Learn](https://www.masterhowtolearn.com/) website.
- My own informal experiments by using Anki.

This means I have *not* used the following as inputs:

- Educational psychology papers reporting on specific experiments: I've trusted other people to do this work for me, including Michael Nielsen, gwern, and the Dunlosky paper. For spaced repetition in particular, I've also found through my own experience that it basically works. I have not searched for, but also have not found, any disagreements with these results (on the order of "all of these papers are fraudulent and you shouldn't trust any of this"). I *have* briefly looked through a bunch of papers in order to figure out if they can teach me more about specific techniques to level up my Anki usage, but have mostly come away disappointed.

## Basic view

Here are my basic conclusions, in the form of stylized facts:

- There are a small core of learning techniques that have been found to basically work. These are: spaced repetition, interleaving, active recall, generation.
- I'm pretty uncertain about higher level learning strategies
- 

## How important is any of this, really?

## Next steps

I think the way to make progress isn't to read more of the literature. The literature tends to test for basic effects but doesn't give you any help on how to take that basic effect and turn it into an effective learning procedure. It tells you that spaced repetition is real, but doesn't tell you the best way to create cards for mathematical proofs in Anki.

Given this, my plans are something like:

- Keep an eye on Michael Nielsen and Andy Matuschak
- Occasionally check r/Anki and some learning blogs, to see if someone has come up with something new
- Continue playing with Anki
