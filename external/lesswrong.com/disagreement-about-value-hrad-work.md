# Locating the crux in the "realism about rationality" debate

## World 1


## World 2


rohin's three-step argument: ok, let's see if it applies to shannon's work in chess.
1. this is a general statement
2. doesn't apply to chess?
3. so is shannon's theory imprecise? i would guess it's precise. so this might be the disanalogy with what miri is attempting.

# Is the disagreement about the value of HRAD work about success criteria or about ability to achieve agreed-upon aims?

I've been thinking about the debate about the value of MIRI's [highly reliable agent designs](https://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf) work (which includes work on decision theory), for example the discussions in [Realism about rationality](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/suxvE2ddnYMPJN9HD/realism-about-rationality) and Daniel Dewey's [My current thoughts on MIRI's "highly reliable agent design" work](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SEL9PW8jozrvLnkb4/my-current-thoughts-on-miri-s-highly-reliable-agent-design).

Something I feel confused about is the extent to which the disagreement is about success criteria vs MIRI's ability to achieve agreed-upon aims. That's a very abstract way of phrasing it, so I want to be more concrete about what I mean.

(Throughout this post I will attribute beliefs to both MIRI and HRAD skeptics. Obviously both groups are heterogeneous and not everyone within a given group will have the same opinion, etc. I don't think it makes a big difference but if you think it does, feel free to suggest some better wording.)

1. "Disagreement is about success criteria" framing: MIRI has one set of success criteria for HRAD work, which is something like "conceptually clarifies the alignment problem; does a thing analogous to the work of Shannon, Turing, Pearl; helps people avoid mistakes analogous to the use of null-terminated strings in C" (let's call these criteria A). Skeptics of HRAD work have another set of criteria for success, which is something like "axiomatically blah blah" (let's call these criteria B). Skeptics agree that criteria A are achievable, but believe that achieving criteria A is insufficient for actually being useful for aligning an AGI. Instead, to be helpful for aligning an AGI, HRAD work must achieve criteria B, and either MIRI isn't even working toward criteria B or else HRAD work won't accomplish criteria B, so HRAD work won't be useful for aligning an AGI.
2. "Disagreement is about MIRI's ability to achieve agreed-upon aims" framing: Both MIRI and skeptics agree on what counts as success for HRAD work, i.e. there is some single success criterion that both sides agree on, which is some mixture of the criteria I listed above. The disagreement is instead about whether MIRI can achieve those goals.


you need to achieve this more difficult thing B; only doing A is insufficient. -- disagreement about success criteria

vs

both sides agree that X is the success criteria.
but then skeptics are like "well i don't think you can do X"
