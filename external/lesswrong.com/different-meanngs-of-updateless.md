## What are all the different meanings of “updateless” used in the wild?

I think i need to break down the idea of “updatelessness” further. My own understanding
is that it’s just whether or not you condition on the sense date inside the probability
part of the expected utility formula. So under this interpretation, all versions of
TDT is not updateless. But Caspar uses “updateless” for anything that doesn’t need
precommitments to win Parfit’s hitchhiker, making TDT updateless.

Plus, if FDT is updateless, then Rob’s comment
doesn’t make sense; what are these philosophical issues around updatelessness that FDT
doesn’t need to accept?

Also by the previous subsection, “updateless” might sometimes be used to mean
“does policy selection”. If this is the case, then some versions of FDT are
“updateless” while others are not.

https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pneKTZG9KqnSe2RdQ/two-types-of-updatelessness abram demski distinguishes between “all-upside updatelessness” and “mixed-upside updatelessness”. Post also talks about policy selection as distinct from updatelessness.

https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1711 apparently there is a parameter $f$ here that determines the level of updatelessness.

“Lately there’s been a bit more doubt about updatelessness (in full generality instead of the partial version attained by policy selection) as being an achievable desiderata.” https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1797 So this also seems to mean that policy selection doesn’t necessarily imply updatelessness.

“An updateless agent is one that does not update on its observations, but instead chooses what action it wants itself to output upon being input those observations.” https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1689 The post distinguishes between empirical updatelessness and logical updatelessness.

page 3 of https://github.com/tsvibt/public-pdfs/blob/master/decision-theory/notation/main.pdf talks about being “updateless with respect to $o$” for some observation $o$.
