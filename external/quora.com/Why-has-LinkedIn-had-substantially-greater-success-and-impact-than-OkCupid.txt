I think it's helpful to consider (1) whether the business-oriented nature of LinkedIn has given it an edge over OKCupid, a dating site; and (2) if there is anything specifically LinkedIn has been doing right that OKCupid hasn't.
It's not too hard to find evidence that online dating has a lot of stigma attached to it. Here is just one article on the topic: Online dating still stigmatized despite popularity, success (http://thegazette.com/2014/03/16/online-dating-still-stigmatized-despite-popularity-sucess/). In general, social networking sites tend to have many more users and much higher Alexa rankings than dating sites (see List of social networking websites (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_websites) and Comparison of online dating websites (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_online_dating_websites)). If we restrict the social networking sites to just business-oriented sites, then we find that LinkedIn has 300 million users (2013), Viadeo has 55 million users (2013), and XING about 11 million users. In contrast, some of the more popular online dating-focused sites like Badoo, Match.com (http://Match.com), and Zoosk have as many as 197 million (2013), 96 million (2010), and 50 million users (2011), respectively. So the numbers seem rather comparable, which means LinkedIn may just be particularly good, and OKCupid, with only 5.6 million active users (2010), may just be particularly bad, in this respect. (Though note here that OKCupid is the only site reporting in terms of *active* users, and not registered users. I'm also not an expert on the other dating sites so I can't say if OKCupid is doing something wrong.)
Other heuristics besides the stigma that one might come up with:

* After a suitable match has been found on a dating website, the users may delete their profiles. I remember reading about an unfortunate couple who had met on OKCupid, deleted their profiles, and now wished to look at them again, for a sense of nostalgia -- but hadn't made backups of their profiles. Businesses, on the other hand, do not care if you have a LinkedIn profile even while you are working for them. (Thanks to Vipul Naik for clarifying this point with me.)
* I get the impression that many people are officially (e.g. schools) or unofficially (e.g. peer pressure) *encouraged* to create LinkedIn profiles, which probably leads to more users, which just doesn't happen for dating sites (although in some social circles, creating online dating profiles may be encouraged somewhat).
* The anonymity on OKCupid, in contrast to people using their real names on LinkedIn, could also be a factor: information on LinkedIn has the ability to be reused elsewhere or have a better chance of having an impact in other places (whereas with OKCupid, only your (potential) partners will ever care about the information, and it won't be linked to your real identity). (Thanks to Vipul Naik for this idea.)
