As far as I know, 80,000 Hours (https://80000hours.org/) is the only explicitly EA organization specializing in career advice. Otherwise, you will have to find individuals who:
* have already completed a similar transition
* work in the area you want to enter
* are knowledgeable about personal finances
* understand your values well (effective altruism, etc.)
* are generally intelligent and can give you feedback
(These donâ€™t all have to be the same person.)
Aside from the above, you will want to do your own reading/research.
