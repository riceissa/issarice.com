(Note: I am still learning decision theory so my understanding is limited and this answer might be wrong, but I wanted to answer my own question since I think Iâ€™ve made some progress.)
Since there are different versions of UDT and FDT, I should say that I am comparing UDT1.1 with the action selection variant of FDT (as described in the FDT paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05060)).
I think one example is the number assignment problem that Wei Dai describes in the UDT1.1 post (https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/g8xh9R7RaNitKtkaa/explicit-optimization-of-global-strategy-fixing-a-bug-in). Since UDT1.1 does policy selection, the two copies pick different options (as explained in the post). However, since the action selection variant of FDT selects an action (like UDT1) the two copies pick the same option.
The FDT paper mentions in a footnote a version of FDT that does policy selection. I think in that case, FDT and UDT1.1 might produce identical decisions. (There is still a difference at the level of formalization, where FDT uses graphical models and UDT uses world programs.)
