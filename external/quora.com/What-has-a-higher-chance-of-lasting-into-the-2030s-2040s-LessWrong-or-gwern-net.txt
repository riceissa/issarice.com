In terms of the existence of the website (domain name and all), I would agree with Vipul (https://www.quora.com/profile/Vipul-Naik) that LessWrong has a better chance of lasting. However in terms of the survival of the content, I'd say gwern's site has a *much better shot*. Everything on the site, along with all the changes, are up on GitHub for anyone to clone. Indeed, at the moment (2015-07-05) there are 7 forks on GitHub already. (As of 2018-09-01, there are five somewhat outdated forks on GitHub (https://github.com/gjord/gwern.net/network).) If it ever goes down, all one would need to do is use the cloned repo and compile the site using Hakyll (which is free software).
Take the content that's been produced so far. What percent of LessWrong content is available now, out of everything that's been produced so far? Definitely not 100%, for comments and even whole posts have been deleted. And if we take into account *usability* of the site, then it's *even lower*, because some external links no longer exist. In contrast, I'd say just about everything that's ever been on gwern's site (sans Disqus comments, which are not too substantial anyway) is still available today; even his deleted pages (like those on homelessness and masturbation) are still available today, as long as you know where to look. Moreover, gwern is good about backing up external sources (he includes PDFs he links to in the git repo, for instance, and also runs scripts to save pages he links to), so usability in the future should be higher as well.
Now, there's also the size of the site that we have to consider. gwern's site is much smaller, so it's easier for projects like the Internet Archive to keep a copy of everything. In contrast, LessWrong is a much larger site with more pages (which are also dynamic, unlike gwern's static pages), so I doubt the Internet Archive has a full copy.
Dynamic content (mentioned above) is indeed *much* harder to backup, and in any case the only way to fully do that would be if the LessWrong sysadmins released database dumps (very unlikely).
Now, the word "lasting" in the question is a bit ambiguous. So far I've talked about "lasting" in terms of readable content, site usability, and so on. But another important aspect of "lasting" for a long time is the community aspect. And here it's a no brainer: LessWrong has already steadily been dying due to all the most prolific contributors leaving the site. In contrast, gwern's site didn't really have any "community" to begin with, so not much is lost even if gwern stops adding to the site (I mean, gwern still slowly adds to the site, but all the most notable pages were already written years back), whereas with LessWrong, interacting with other readers is a fundamental aspect of the site.
