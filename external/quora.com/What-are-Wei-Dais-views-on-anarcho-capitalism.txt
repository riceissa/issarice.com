I don’t really know, but I’ve found some clues so I’m posting this answer.
In one LW comment (http://lesswrong.com/lw/bl2/a_belief_propagation_graph/6abz) Wei says he used to be libertarian, but is now not very political.
In another LW comment (http://lesswrong.com/lw/1m5/savulescu_genetically_enhance_humanity_or_face/1fh8) he says “Libertarianism decreases some types of existential risk and bad outcomes in general, but increases other types (like UFAI).”
