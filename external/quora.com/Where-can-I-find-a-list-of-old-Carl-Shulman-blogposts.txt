I made a list at Timeline of Carl Shulman publications (https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Carl_Shulman_publications) (you can sort by the “Format” column and look at the rows with “Blog post”). I’m not exactly sure what the question means by “old” blog posts; if there are even older blog posts that are no longer public (or something like that) then I don’t know.
