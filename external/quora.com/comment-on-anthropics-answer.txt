Thanks. I read your section at Anthropics without Reference Classes | Essays on Reducing Suffering (http://reducing-suffering.org/anthropics-without-reference-classes/#Update_Feb_2015_You_are_all_your_copies) and I’ve also seen comments like Louie’s at Louie comments on Anthropic decision theory I: Sleeping beauty and selflessness - Less Wrong (http://lesswrong.com/lw/891/anthropic_decision_theory_i_sleeping_beauty_and/55p2). Eliezer’s comment at Alyssa Vance (https://www.facebook.com/alyssamvance/posts/10205442165803261) seems to indicate the problem was largely unsolved in 2014 (Stuart’s latest draft of “Anthropic Decision Theory” is more recent than Eliezer’s comment, so I wonder what he would say now).
(I guess I’m trying to give more context to the question, even though you’ve answered it. I was wondering if I was missing something major.)
