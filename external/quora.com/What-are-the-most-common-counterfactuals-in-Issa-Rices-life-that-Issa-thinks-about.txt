As of 2019:
* What would my life be like if I had a different appearance (taller/shorter, more/less attractive, pure instead of mixed race/ethnicity)?
* What would I have done if my family had stayed in Japan instead of moving to the US?
* What would my life look like if I had different parents (e.g. if the current version of me was my own parent, or if my parent was someone like Eliezer Yudkowsky, Wei Dai, or Vipul Naik)?
* How would my personality change if I had more female attention?
* What would I be doing if my life was the same until the end of high school but I then attended MIT instead of UW?
* How would my life be different if people (especially women) were smarter? (here, “smarter” means “more competent, has a better understanding of the world, can think about crazy ideas without going insane, etc.” and not just “higher IQ”)
* What would my life have been like if I was born in a different in a different age (e.g. born as one of the earliest humans, or as a forager, or as an early farmer, or before the internet, or born in the present)?
* What would I be like if my IQ was higher or lower?
* What grants would I give out if I had more money or if I was in charge of an organization like Open Philanthropy Project?
* What would I be doing with my life if I had never discovered LessWrong, effective altruism, or Vipul Naik?
* How would my life be different if the rationality or effective altruism community had more of the kinds of people I could get along with on a personal level? (I’ve found maybe two people from these communities that I get along well with, which is pretty good, but they are somewhat peripheral characters, so I’m wondering how things would be different if I could get along more with the central characters in these communities)
* How would my life be different if the sort of thing I was trying to do with my life (the ultimate Weipill, or whatever) had a more established path, such that mentors and other support structure existed?
I think probably a large part of my personality has been shaped by the kinds of environment I was placed in. There are many things about me (e.g. my distrust of happiness, my cynicism about other people, my skepticism of various institutions) that I’m not sure I would really agree with upon deep reflection, but which are too hard to change. So this thought of “What changes in the environment could have caused me to become a happier, more socially well-adjusted person?” provides a source for counterfactuals I think about. I often think about the alternate reality scene from episode 26 of NGE.
