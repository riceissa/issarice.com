I still feel like I only have a vague answer to this question, but here is what I have found so far.
In 2014 he said (http://lesswrong.com/lw/jgz/aalwa_ask_any_lesswronger_anything/aq5j):
>If you go through my posts on LW, you can read most of the questions that I've been thinking about in the last few years. I don't think any of the problems that I raised have been solved so I'm still attempting to answer them. To give a general idea, these include questions in philosophy of mind, philosophy of math, decision theory, normative ethics, meta-ethics, meta-philosophy. And to give a specific example I've just been thinking about again recently: What is pain exactly (e.g., in a mathematical or algorithmic sense) and why is it bad? For example can certain simple decision algorithms be said to have pain? Is pain intrinsically bad, or just because people prefer not to be in pain?
In the same comment he said:
>I do read a bunch of other blogs, but tend not to comment much elsewhere since I like having an archive of my writings for future reference, and it's too much trouble to do that if I distribute them over many different places.
In 2017 he asked (http://lesswrong.com/lw/p5p/open_thread_june_19_june_25_2017/du6e) about extracurricular activities for children, suggesting that he might be raising kids.
He did quit (http://lesswrong.com/lw/kk5/look_for_the_next_tech_gold_rush/b4wg) working in 2003 so I donâ€™t think he works on any project to earn money.
