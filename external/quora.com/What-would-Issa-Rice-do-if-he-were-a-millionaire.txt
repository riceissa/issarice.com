This would largely depend on where on the millionaire spectrum I was. A single million dollars isn't very much money, and wouldn't influence my actions very much (since I’m mostly happy with the work I’m doing for pay). Most likely I would just save it and invest it accordingly so as to have a comfortable financial buffer from which to draw so I don’t need to work for pay.
In terms of selfish investments, I would probably do cryonics, ergonomics and longevity-related purchases, and personal tutoring to accelerate my learning on some subjects.
I would also want to start hiring people to take on projects that I can’t complete on my own.

I would also probably donate more; GiveWell (http://www.givewell.org/)'s recommendations are a good start.
With even more money, see A Long-run perspective on strategic cause selection and philanthropy (http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/5g/a_longrun_perspective_on_strategic_cause/).
At least initially, I would put in a lot of time into figuring out how to spend the money well, so I expect my opinions would change (possibly substantially) if I actually had the money.
