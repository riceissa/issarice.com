This would largely depend on where on the millionaire spectrum I was. A single million dollars isn't very much money, and wouldn't influence my actions very much (for instance, I would still complete my undergraduate degree, get a job, etc.). Most likely I would just save it and invest it accordingly so as to have a comfortable financial buffer. Having a large financial buffer, in turn, will allow me to take on bigger and riskier bets (e.g. quitting a typical programming job in order to do cause prioritization research (http://causeprioritization.org/) full-time [disclosure: I run the site]).
In terms of selfish investments, What would Alex K. Chen do if he were a millionaire? (https://www.quora.com/What-would-Alex-K-Chen-do-if-he-were-a-millionaire) has some good ideas. In general, I would lean toward spending money on ergonomics and longevity-related purchases. In addition to the points in Alex's answer, I might in addition consider more strongly cryonics, for example.
I would also probably donate more; GiveWell (http://www.givewell.org/)'s recommendations are a good start.
