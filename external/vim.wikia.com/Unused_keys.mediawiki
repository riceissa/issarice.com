This page lists single unused keys in Vim. As such, it is an inverted version of {{help|index}}. In addition, the page lists synonyms that can safely be mapped.

Many more mappings are possible by combining keys. See the article "Follow my leader" below in [[#External links|ยง External links]] below for hints on combining keys.

In the following table, "Free" means a key is not used in Vim by default, whereas "Synonym" means a key is used in Vim by default but is a synonym for some other key that is also used in Vim by default so that there is no danger in mapping it.

{| class="sortable wikitable"
! Key !! Mode !! Type !! Notes
|-
| Function keys || All modes || Free || For instance, <code>&lt;F6&gt;</code>
|-
| Alt key combinations || All modes || Free || For instance, <code>&lt;M-q&gt;</code>. Note that mapping alt keys can be problematic depending on the terminal emulator. See e.g. {{help|:map-alt-keys}} for more information.
|-
| <code>&lt;C-S&gt;</code> || All modes || Free || This key is used for [[wikipedia:Software flow control|flow control]] on the terminal so Vim does not touch it. However, on modern machines most people have no use for flow control so you can run <code>stty -ixon</code> in your shell to unlock it for your own use.
|-
| <code>&lt;C-Q&gt;</code> || All modes || Free || Used for flow control like <code>&lt;C-S&gt;</code>
|-
| <code>+</code> || Normal || Synonym || Synonym for <code>&lt;CR&gt;</code>
|-
| <code>_</code> || Normal || Synonym || This is nearly the same as <code>&lt;CR&gt;</code>
|-
| <code>K</code> || Normal || || By default, this is an inferior version of <code>&lt;Leader&gt;K</code> that can be obtained through man.vim with <code>runtime! ftplugin/man.vim</code>. See {{help|find-manpage}} for more.
|-
| <code>s</code> || Normal || Synonym || Synonym for <code>cl</code>
|-
| <code>S</code> || Normal || Synonym || Synonym for <code>cc</code>
|-
| <code>&lt;C-@&gt;</code> || Normal || Free || This can also be entered with <code>&lt;C-Space&gt;</code>
|-
| <code>&lt;C-J&gt;</code> || Normal || Synonym || Synonym for <code>j</code>
|-
| <code>&lt;C-K&gt;</code> || Normal || Free ||
|-
| <code>&lt;C-N&gt;</code> || Normal || Synonym || Synonym for <code>j</code>
|-
| <code>&lt;C-P&gt;</code> || Normal || Synonym || Synonym for <code>k</code>
|-
| <code>&lt;C-[&gt;</code> || Normal || Free || This is the same as <code>&lt;Esc&gt;</code>
|-
| <code>&lt;C-_&gt;</code> || Normal || Free || This is the same as <code><C-/></code>
|-
| <code>K</code> || Visual || Synonym || Synonym for <code><Esc>K</code>. In visual mode, this key only works when the selection is one line.
|-
| <code>&lt;C-J&gt;</code> || Insert || Synonym || Synonym for <code>&lt;CR&gt;</code>
|-
| <code>&lt;C-B&gt;</code> || Insert || Free ||
|-
| <code>&lt;C-Z&gt;</code> || Insert || Free || Unless you use evim.
|-
| <code>&lt;C-@&gt;</code> || Command-line || ||
|-
| <code>&lt;C-O&gt;</code> || Command-line || ||
|-
| <code>&lt;C-X&gt;</code> || Command-line || ||
|-
| <code>&lt;C-Z&gt;</code> || Command-line || ||
|}
