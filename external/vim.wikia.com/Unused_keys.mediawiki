This page lists single unused keys in Vim. As such, it is an inverted version of {{help|index}}. In addition, the page lists synonyms that can safely be mapped.

Many more mappings are possible by combining keys.

In the following table, "Free" means a key is not used in Vim by default, whereas "Synonym" means a key is used in Vim by default but is a synonym for some other key that is also used in Vim by default so that there is no danger in mapping it.
