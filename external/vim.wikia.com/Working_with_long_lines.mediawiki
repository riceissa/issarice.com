This page explains several strategies for dealing with long lines in Vim, especially very long lines that fill up the entire screen. You may encounter these files because some conventions require it (e.g. the English Wikipedia favors single-line paragraphs), or because some "dump" files use long lines.

Vim, having decended from line-based editors, works by default on ''logical lines'' rather than ''visual lines''. For instance, the <code>j</code> movement in normal mode moves down by one logical line rather than one visual line (which is the default in many CUA editors including web browser text boxes).

At a high level, the strategies for dealing with long lines can be grouped in the following way:

* Making use of Vim's built-in capabilities for navigating long lines without chopping them
* Preprocessing the file to use shorter lines, sometimes called "chopping" the line
* Taking steps to prevent long lines

==Vim's built-in capabilities==

Vim can attempt to show long lines with <code>:set wrap</code>. With <code>:set linebreak</code>, Vim will wrap the lines at characters in <code>'breakat'</code>; this generally makes the text easier to read.

talk about

* <code>gj</code>, <code>gk</code>, search-to-navigate, <code>f</code> and <code>t</code> are now more powerful in some sense, because they can keep going along
* <code>:set display+=lastline</code>
* <code>:set scrolloff=99999</code> will keep the cursor in the middle of the screen, providing more context even in very long lines.


==Preprocessing long lines==

Most programming environments offer generic tools for formatting text. These include <code>fold</code>, <code>fmt</code>, and <code>par</code>. From inside Vim, one can invoke

<pre>
:%!fmt -80 -s
</pre>

to format the current buffer. The <code>-80</code> specifies 80 columns as the desired width and the <code>-s</code> tells <code>fmt</code> to split lines only (i.e. to not join short lines together).

<code>fold</code> is more aggressive, and will chop lines even if there is no space.

In addition, Vim itself provides the command <code>gqq</code> to format the current line, so something like

<pre>
:%normal! gqq
</pre>

If the original linebreak locations must be preserved, then you can leave a unique character in place of linebreaks:

<pre>
command! ShortLines :%s/.\{71}/&↵\r/g | 0
command! ShortLinesAtSpace :%s/.\{70,79} /&↵\r/g | 0
command! LongLines :%s/↵\n// | 0
</pre>

(Note that this sort of regex replacement only works on small files.)

Instead of generic tools, one can sometimes do better by using a tool suited to a particular filetype.

If you are working with JSON files and have Python installed (note: this is just the system binary rather than Python support being compiled into Vim):

<pre>
:%!python -m json.tool
</pre>

will convert the buffer into pretty-printed JSON. There are also plugins like [https://github.com/tpope/vim-jdaddy jdaddy.vim] that are designed to make work with JSON easier.

For HTML and XML, there are tools like <code>tidy</code> and <code>xmllint</code>; see [[Cleanup your HTML]] for the main article.

In some cases, <code>gg=G</code> might make things nicer.

also mention [https://github.com/Chiel92/vim-autoformat vim-autoformat].

[https://github.com/maksimr/vim-jsbeautify] might be a more general tool.

languages like Go have strong source formatting requirements and provide tools like <code>gofmt</code>.

==Preventing long lines==

Since long lines are rather painful to work with in Vim (and not just Vim; diffing tools often have trouble with long lines as well), it's a good idea to keep lines short.

<pre>
:set textwidth=80
</pre>

Some filetypes like mail and Vimscript automatically set this option.
