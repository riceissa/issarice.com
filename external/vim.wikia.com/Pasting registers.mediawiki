It is possible to paste the contents of any register into the current buffer or command-line.

==In normal and visual modes==

In general, <code>"<i>reg</i>p</code> pastes the contents of the register ''reg''. For instance, <code>"ap</code> pastes the contents of the register <code>a</code>.

Just as <code>"+p</code> (or <code>"*p</code>) pastes the contents of the clipboard, other registers can be pasted as well.

Use <code>":p</code> to paste the last command. For example, you might want to save a complex search and replace (<code>:%s///g</code>) that you have just used.

Use <code>"/p</code> to paste the last search.

==In insert and command-line modes==

In insert and command-line modes, you can use Ctrl-r to paste the contents of a register. For instance, pressing Ctrl-r followed by <code>a</code> (i.e. <code><C-r>a</code>) pastes the contents of the register <code>a</code>. This works with special registers as well, so <code><C-r>+</code> pastes from the clipboard and <code><C-r>/</code> pastes the last search.

Note that because Vim faithfully translates the contents of the clipboard to a buffer in insert mode, using <code><C-r>+</code> is susceptible to attacks if the contents of the clipboard cannot be fully trusted. This is sometimes called "clipboard hijacking". For instance, if one copies text from a website that contains a literal escape character (i.e. the character with ASCII value 27, ''not'' a representation of the escape character such as <code><Esc></code>), Vim will faithfully switch to normal mode and begin executing normal mode commands. Some browsers hide special characters when displaying a page, so it is not immediately obvious even if one has copied malicious text. Moreover, using clever div-tag positioning, even browsers that display special characters are susceptible to such attacks ([http://thejh.net/misc/website-terminal-copy-paste proof of concept]). It is possible to use <code><C-o>"+p</code> instead, which prevents attacks of this form.
