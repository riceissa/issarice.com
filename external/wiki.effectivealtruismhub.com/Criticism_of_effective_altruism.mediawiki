If everybody gave as they did, we might well end up solving Third World crises at the expense of deepening crises right here at home. Rampant poverty and public health challenges in the United States would ultimately damage our local and national economies, diminishing our long-term capacity to help abroad. In addition, many of the things that are important to our souls — beauty, hope, joy, tolerance, inspiration — are fostered through the arts. They may be very hard to sufficiently measure in a world of purely data-driven philanthropy. This does not mean they are not important.</p><p>There is also a condescending undertone to the effective altruist approach. It assumes, however unintentionally, that the poor need only their basic needs met, that they do not have the same need as others do for the beauty and inspiration of the arts. Clearly we need to do a much better job communicating to the effective altruists the connection between the arts and other social challenges.</p></blockquote>

Effective altruism leaves such economies wholly unaccounted for. And when followed to its logical conclusion, it is their enemy.</blockquote>

I suspect that eigenaltruism is game-theoretically superior to merit-blind altruism and also more sustainable and psychologically palatable.

== Summary ==
Much of the controversy about effective altruism is due to the idea that it can be ethical to take a high-earning career in a potentially unethical industry if this allows one to donate more money. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brooks_(journalist) David Brooks], a columnist for ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times The New York Times]'', criticized effective altruists who adopt the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earning_to_give earning to give] strategy, i.e., they take high-earning careers in order to have more money to donate. He believes that most people who work in finance and other high-paying industries value money for selfish reasons and that being surrounded by these people will cause effective altruists to become less altruistic.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-:3_7-1" style="line-height:1;unicode-bidi:-webkit-isolate;font-size:11.1999998092651px;">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism#cite_note-:3-7 [7]]</sup> Some effective altruists also mention this possibility, and aim to reduce this risk through online communities, public pledges, and donations through [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donor-advised_fund donor-advised funds].<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-50" style="line-height:1;unicode-bidi:-webkit-isolate;font-size:11.1999998092651px;">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism#cite_note-50 [50]]</sup> He also questions whether children in distant countries should be treated as having equal moral value to nearby children. He claims that morality should be "internally ennobling", a position similar to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics virtue ethics].<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-:3_7-2" style="line-height:1;unicode-bidi:-webkit-isolate;font-size:11.1999998092651px;">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism#cite_note-:3-7 [7]]</sup>

An article by Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry in ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Week The Week]'' questioned whether effective altruism could change the world. It said: "The point is this: Effective Altruism, while very welcome, is not an "objective" look at the value of philanthropy; instead it is a method replete with philosophical assumptions. And that's fine, so long as everyone realizes it."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-51" style="line-height:1;unicode-bidi:-webkit-isolate;font-size:11.1999998092651px;">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism#cite_note-51 [51]]</sup>

In a response to criticism of this aspect of effective altruism, the ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Review National Review]'' questioned whether industries commonly believed to be unethical, such as finance, are actually unethical.

Their critique, which goes so far to label the movement "defective altruism", alleges that effective altruists moralistically select a few causes as worthy and deem all others "a waste of precious resources."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-55" style="line-height:1;unicode-bidi:-webkit-isolate;font-size:11.1999998092651px;">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism#cite_note-55 [55]]</sup> The critique provoked strong responses from effective altruists, both in the comments on SSIR's website and elsewhere, including a response piece (also published in SSIR) in which [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_MacAskill William MacAskill] defended the utilitarian logic the movement uses to evaluate the effectiveness of different charities.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-56" style="line-height:1;unicode-bidi:-webkit-isolate;font-size:11.1999998092651px;">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism#cite_note-56 [56]]</sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-57" style="line-height:1;unicode-bidi:-webkit-isolate;font-size:11.1999998092651px;">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism#cite_note-57 [57]]</sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-58" style="line-height:1;unicode-bidi:-webkit-isolate;font-size:11.1999998092651px;">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism#cite_note-58 [58]]</sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-59" style="line-height:1;unicode-bidi:-webkit-isolate;font-size:11.1999998092651px;">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism#cite_note-59 [59]]</sup>

A Kenyan activist argues that Americans (though the point applies more broadly, of course) should stay in their own countries and tackle problems like homelessness and police racism, rather than trying to save Africa. He explicitly disagrees with the suggestion (made by a young black American woman) that we should prioritise problems in the developing world because they are more severe. It's also noteworthy for making many of the same arguments for "Philanthrolocalism" as the article "[http://www.philanthropydaily.com/the-coming-showdown-between-philanthrolocalism-and-effective-altruism/ The coming showdown between philanthrolocalism and effective altruism]" e.g. that it's better to focus on your local community where people know you and you know them.
