'''Methods of discovering causal effects''': basically, after observing or interacting with the environment, how can we discover what causes what? When are we justified to claim causal effects (not just correlation)?

| Randomized controlled trial || <ref name="shalizi-identifying-causal-effects" /> Michael Nielsen also talks about this in his tutorial || There are lots of examples of this. It would be good to explain a concrete one. For now, I'll just link to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial#In_social_science this section on Wikipedia].

| The [[Do calculus|''do'' calculus]] || This allows us to infer causal effects just by observation. I think this one breaks down into further strategies. Three of them are listed in p. 30 of <ref>Stephen L. Morgan; Christopher Winship. ''Counterfactual and Causal Inference: Methods and Principles for Social Research''. 2nd ed.
