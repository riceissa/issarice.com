Tao's notation for a limit is <math>\lim_{x\to x_0;\, x\in E} f(x)</math>.

Can we write this in a more standard way? basically, if we give one additional definition, we have the very appealing formula <math>\lim_{x\to x_0;\, x\in E} f(x) = \lim_{x\to x_0} f|_E(x)</math>.

The additional definition is this: if <math>f : X \to \mathbf R</math>, then we define <math>\lim_{x\to x_0} f(x) := \lim_{x\to x_0;\, x \in X} f(x)</math>. In other words, by default we assume that the limit is taken over the entire domain of the function.

Now, given <math>f : X \to \mathbf R</math> and some <math>E \subseteq X</math>, we have <math>f|_E : E \to \mathbf R</math>. Thus, <math>\lim_{x\to x_0} f|_E(x) = \lim_{x\to x_0;\, x \in E} f|_E(x)</math>.

By exercise 9.4.6, <math>\lim_{x \to x_0;\, x\in E} f(x) = \lim_{x\to x_0;\, x\in E} f|_E(x)</math>

Combining these two equalities, we have <math>\lim_{x \to x_0;\, x\in E} f(x) = \lim_{x\to x_0} f|_E(x)</math> as promised.

Rather than thinking of this as a result per se, I think it's better to think of this as ''alternative notations''. Why might one prefer one notation over the other? I think the strength of Tao's notation is that it works for anonymous functions/expressions. To be able to use the function restriction notation <math>f|_E</math>, we must have named our function beforehand. To give an example, we can write something like <math>\lim_{x\to 0;\, x\in (0,\infty)} |x|/x = 1</math>, but this is difficult to write in the other notation; we would have to say something like, "Let <math>f:\mathbf R\setminus \{0\} \to \mathbf R</math> be defined by <math>f(x) := |x|/x</math>. Then we have <math>\lim_{x\to 0} f|_{(0,\infty)}(x) = 1</math>."

An amusing fact/potential advantage of the function restriction notation is that one can write it in a ''point-free notation''. Namely, we can write <math>\lim_{x_0} f|_E</math>. Actually, even with Tao's notation we could have written <math>\lim_{x_0;\, E} f</math>.

I think usually one would write the above like <math>\lim_{x\to 0+} |x|/x = 1</math>. So then one gets to keep anonymous functions, but at the expense of adding more complexity to the notation (one now needs to assign meaning to "<math>0+</math>").

One should compare this to the function notation (<math>f'</math>) vs Leibniz notation (<math>\frac{d}{dx} f(x)</math>) for derivatives.
