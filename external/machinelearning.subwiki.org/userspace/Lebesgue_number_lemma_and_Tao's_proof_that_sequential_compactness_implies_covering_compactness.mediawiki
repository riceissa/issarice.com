One typical statement of the Lebesgue number lemma is the following: Let <math>(X,d)</math> be a metric space, and let <math>Y</math> be a subset of <math>X</math>. Let <math>(V_\alpha)_{\alpha \in A}</math> be a collection of open sets. Then there exists a number <math>\lambda > 0</math> such that for all <math>y \in Y</math> there is some <math>\alpha \in A</math> such that <math>B(y, \lambda) \subseteq V_\alpha</math>.

The idea is that we can find some fixed radius <math>\lambda</math>, and consider balls <math>B(y, \lambda)</math> as we move around in <math>Y</math>. We might think that at some of these places, our ball <math>B(y, \lambda)</math> will be "broken up" by not being entirely within some single <math>V_\alpha</math>. But the Lebesgue number lemma says this is not the case, that we can move around freely within <math>Y</math> and always have our balls entirely living inside some <math>V_\alpha</math> (of course, the specific index <math>\alpha</math> may change as we move around).

In ''Analysis II'', Terence Tao shows something similar when he proves that sequential compactness implies covering compactness for metric spaces. Specifically, he defines for each <math>y \in Y</math> the number <math>r(y) := \sup\{ r > 0 : B(y,r) \subseteq V_\alpha \text{ for some } \alpha \in A \}</math> (the set here is non-empty because the collection covers <math>Y</math>, so <math>r(y)</math> is positive). Then he takes the infimum of all these <math>r(y)</math>s, <math>r_0 := \inf\{ r(y) : y \in Y\}</math>. He then shows that <math>r_0 > 0</math> (this is the content of Case 1 of his proof).

It looks like <math>r_0</math> is playing the role of <math>\lambda</math> in the usual statement of the Lebesgue number lemma, but this is not exactly right (rather, any number less than <math>r_0</math> is a Lebesgue number).

But in fact, the statement that <math>r_0 > 0</math> is equivalent to the Lebesgue number lemma, and this is not hard to show.

Suppose <math>r_0 > 0</math>. Let <math>y \in Y</math> be arbitrary. Then <math>r(y) \in \{r(y) : y \in Y\}</math> so <math>r(y) \geq r_0</math>. Now consider any number <math>\lambda > 0</math> such that <math>\lambda < r_0</math>. We have <math>r(y) = \sup\{ r > 0 : B(y,r) \subseteq V_\alpha \text{ for some } \alpha \in A\} \geq r_0 > \lambda > 0</math>. The important thing is that <math>\lambda</math> cannot be an upper bound for the set <math>\{ r > 0 : B(y,r) \subseteq V_\alpha \text{ for some } \alpha \in A\}</math>. Thus there exists some <math>r</math> in this set such that <math>r > \lambda</math>, which means that <math>B(y,\lambda) \subseteq B(y, r) \subseteq V_\alpha</math> for some <math>\alpha \in A</math>. We have just shown the Lebesgue number lemma.

Now suppose the Lebesgue number lemma is true. Then we are given some <math>\lambda > 0</math>. Thus if <math>y \in Y</math> then there is some <math>\alpha \in A</math> such that <math>B(y, \lambda) \subseteq V_\alpha</math>. Since <math>r(y)</math> is the supremum of such radii, we have <math>r(y) \geq \lambda</math>. Now taking the infimum over <math>y</math>, we have <math>r_0 \geq \lambda > 0</math>.
