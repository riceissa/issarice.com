This is an exercise from Tao's ''Analysis I'' (exercise 3.5.6) and from Munkres's ''Topology'' (exercise 1.1.2(k)â€“(l)). It is an exercise that makes apparent some of the subtleties of the basic logic used in math.

The exercise is to consider the sets <math>A,B,C,D</math> and the two statements:

# <math>A \subseteq C</math> and <math>B \subseteq D</math>; and
# <math>A\times B \subseteq C\times D</math>;

and to ask whether one implies the other (or whether the two statements are equivalent).

==Relationship between the statements==

In general, (1) implies (2). In other words, if <math>A \subseteq C</math> and <math>B \subseteq D</math>, then <math>A\times B \subseteq C\times D</math>.

If <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> are nonempty sets, then (1) and (2) are logically equivalent. In other words, <math>A \subseteq C</math> and <math>B \subseteq D</math> if and only if <math>A\times B \subseteq C\times D</math>.

If <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> are both empty, then (1) and (2) are logically equivalent; in fact, they are both true.

==Each statement written out in first-order logic==

# <math>\forall x (x \in A \implies x \in C) \wedge \forall y (y \in B \implies y \in D)</math>
# <math>\forall x \forall y ((x \in A \wedge y \in B) \implies (x \in C \wedge y \in D))</math>

==Erroneous general proof==

Here is an erroneous general proof that (2) implies (1).

==Counterexample==

Here is a counterexample that shows that in general, (2) does not imply (1). Let <math>A := \{1\}</math>, <math>B := \emptyset</math>, <math>C := \emptyset</math>, and <math>D := \{1\}</math>. Then

<math display="block">A\times B = \{1\}\times \emptyset =\emptyset \subseteq \emptyset = \emptyset \times \{1\} = C \times D</math>

but 

<math display="block">A = \{1\} \not\subseteq \emptyset = C</math>

Thus (2) is true but (1) is false.
