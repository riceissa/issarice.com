==Negation==

Negating a strong statement produces a weak statement, and negating a weak statement produces a strong statement. If a statement has strong and weak components, then the flip occurs at each stage. For example, in <math display="inline">\forall x W(x)</math> with <math display="inline">W(x)</math> a weak statement, negating it produces <math display="inline">\exists x \neg W(x)</math>, where the strong <math display="inline">\forall x</math> has become the weak <math display="inline">\exists x</math>, and the weak <math display="inline">W(x)</math> has become a strong <math display="inline">\neg W(x)</math>. See Gowers's posts for more discussion on this.

==Strong vs subset==

A puzzle: why do we say P is stronger than Q if P is a subset of Q, but we also say that a theorem is stronger if it is more general (so bigger)?

* One reply/intuition uses something like possible world semantics, e.g. see [https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JdK3kr4ug9kJvKzGy/probability-space-and-aumann-agreement Wei Dai's post on Aumann's agreement theorem]. There is just one possible world (a single <math>\omega \in \Omega</math>), but our information state is the set of all possible worlds that we cannot distinguish, so the less we know, the more possible worlds we think we could be in.
* One visualization is to use a Venn diagram. The stronger the statement, the more our movement is restricted, as we are forced to be in more and more sets.
* When we say a strong statement like <math>\forall x P(x)</math>, we are saying <math>P(x_1) \wedge P(x_2) \wedge \cdots \wedge P(x_n)</math>. When we say a weak statement like <math>\exists x P(x)</math>, we are saying <math>P(x_1) \vee P(x_2) \vee \cdots \vee P(x_n)</math>. It seems like in both cases we are accumulating more and more things.
