==Negation==

Negating a strong statement produces a weak statement, and negating a weak statement produces a strong statement. If a statement has strong and weak components, then the flip occurs at each stage. For example, in <math display="inline">\forall x W(x)</math> with <math display="inline">W(x)</math> a weak statement, negating it produces <math display="inline">\exists x \neg W(x)</math>, where the strong <math display="inline">\forall x</math> has become the weak <math display="inline">\exists x</math>, and the weak <math display="inline">W(x)</math> has become a strong <math display="inline">\neg W(x)</math>. See Gowers's posts for more discussion on this.

==Strong vs subset==

A puzzle: why do we say P is stronger than Q if P is a subset of Q, but we also say that a theorem is stronger if it is more general (so bigger)?

* One reply/intuition uses something like possible world semantics, e.g. see [https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JdK3kr4ug9kJvKzGy/probability-space-and-aumann-agreement Wei Dai's post on Aumann's agreement theorem]. There is just one possible world (a single <math>\omega \in \Omega</math>), but our information state is the set of all possible worlds that we cannot distinguish, so the less we know, the more possible worlds we think we could be in.
* One visualization is to use a Venn diagram. The stronger the statement, the more our movement is restricted, as we are forced to be in more and more sets.
* When we say a strong statement like <math>\forall x P(x)</math>, we are saying <math>P(x_1) \wedge P(x_2) \wedge \cdots \wedge P(x_n)</math>. When we say a weak statement like <math>\exists x P(x)</math>, we are saying <math>P(x_1) \vee P(x_2) \vee \cdots \vee P(x_n)</math>. It seems like in both cases we are accumulating more and more things.
* But if we're working in a proof system, <math display="inline">\forall x P(x)</math> means we have all of <math display="inline">P(x_1), \ldots, P(x_n)</math> separately, whereas with <math display="inline">\exists x P(x)</math> we only have one long statement <math>P(x_1) \vee P(x_2) \vee \cdots \vee P(x_n)</math>.
* In causal inference, I think <math display="inline">X \perp\!\!\!\perp Y\cup W</math> is stronger than <math display="inline">(X \perp\!\!\!\perp Y) \vee (X \perp\!\!\!\perp W)</math>, even though both seem to use a single "or"-type operation. But if <math display="inline">Y</math> and <math display="inline">W</math> are disjoint, then I think the former is true while the latter may be false. I think this is similar to how <math display="inline">\forall x\in X(P(x))</math> is usually stronger than <math display="inline">\exists x\in X(P(x))</math>, unless <math display="inline">X = \emptyset</math>.
* Maybe another way to state the puzzle is this: "P is stronger than Q" ↔ "P implies Q" ↔ "Q is at least as true as P" ↔ "Q ≥ P" (as truth values T=1 and F=0) ↔ "Q is 'at least as powerful as' P"! Obviously, the last link is the problem.
* Let's say we have <math display="inline">P(x) \wedge P(y) \wedge P(z)</math>. Then we can deduce <math display="inline">P(y)</math>. So we can say <math display="inline">(P(x) \wedge P(y) \wedge P(z)) \implies P(y)</math>. Let's visualize this by drawing each of <math display="inline">P(x), P(y), P(z)</math> as points. Then if we know <math display="inline">P(x) \wedge P(y) \wedge P(z)</math>, the set of statements we know is <math display="inline">A := \{P(x), P(y), P(z)\}</math>. The set of statements we are trying to prove is <math display="inline">B := \{P(y)\}</math>. But now notice something strange: <math display="inline">A</math> is stronger than <math display="inline">B</math>, but we have <math display="inline">B \subsetneq A</math>. A question might be: how do we visualize <math display="inline">P(x) \vee P(y) \vee P(z)</math> in this scheme? My first thought was "Maybe we need three copies of the diagram, so that we have <math display="inline">(P(x) \wedge P(y) \wedge P(z)) \implies P(x)</math>, <math display="inline">(P(x) \wedge P(y) \wedge P(z)) \implies P(y)</math>, and <math display="inline">(P(x) \wedge P(y) \wedge P(z)) \implies P(z)</math>". But maybe a better way to think of this is that each set such as <math display="inline">B</math> above is a ''microcosm''. Once you're in <math display="inline">B</math>, it's not as small as you thought! You're actually in the set <math display="inline">\{P(y), P(y) \vee P(x), P(y) \vee P(z), P(y) \vee P(x) \vee P(z)\}</math>. And once you're in this microcosm/"kingdom", you can navigate to wherever you please.
* The above vs joint distribution. Symbolically, the contrast between <math display="inline">\Pr(x,y,z)</math> (the joint distribution specifies an elementary event, which is small, whereas a marginal distribution specifies a "lumped together" event, which is large) and <math display="inline">P(x),P(y),P(z)</math> (the more statements we know, the larger the set of statements we know).
