'''Causal inference''' has to do with inferring causes of phenomena rather than just finding correlations.

==Is this even machine learning?==

"It's probably obvious I think this is incredibly neat, and even one of the most important ideas to come out of machine learning." http://bactra.org/notebooks/graphical-causal-models.html

It does get discussed in the context of ML, but I don't think I see it in the usual topics list of ML
