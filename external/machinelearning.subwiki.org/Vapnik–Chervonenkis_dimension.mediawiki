* baum's ''What is thought'' contains a discussion 

I think there's three different "views" of the VC dimension:

* in terms of sets/powersets and shattering
* in terms of fitting parameters for a function
* adversarial/game: to show the VC dimension is at least ''n'': you choose ''n'' points, the adversary chooses the labels, you must find a hypothesis from the hypothesis class that separates the labels cleanly

questions:

* does this work with more than two labels? (with the power sets view, obviously there's only yes/no classifications. but with the other two views, you can generalize to more labels; does doing this yield anything useful?)
* in the adversarial perspective, why do you get to pick the points? (this is a question about which definition is most useful.) is there a name for the thing where you can separate ''all'' points and all labels?
* where does the hypothesis class come from? it seems like "lines", "circles", "convex sets" are some examples used.
