What does it mean for a definition to be covariant or contravariant?


In [this answer](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/113698/why-do-introductory-real-analysis-courses-teach-bottom-up/113805#113805), Brian M. Scott lists different definitions of continuity, and for some of them mentions whether they are covariant or contravariant. I am familiar with these terms from [subtyping in programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)), but I haven't seen these terms applied to mathematical definitions before.

Some questions I have:

1. What does it mean for a definition to be covariant or contravariant? Is there a precise definition or is it more informal?
2. When can a definition be covariant or contravariant? What are some other examples of covariant or contravariant definitions?
3. Is there a way to search for this usage of these terms? When I try to search for the application of these terms to definitions, the search engine (understandably) mistakenly assumes I am looking for the definitions of these terms.
