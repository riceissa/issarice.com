Many thanks for starting this website!

My own experience with building data-heavy websites is that making the site itself is a good first step but this needs to be done in tandem with data collection, and that the data does not collect itself.

From your post and GitHub repository it is not clear to me what you envisage in terms of data collection.

Here are some places from which to gather project ideas:

- [Concrete project lists](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/18p/concrete_project_lists/)
- The [dotimpact projects list](https://impact.hackpad.com/Projects-aRiPtncmuKS)
- The effectivealtruism.org entry for ["Start an EA-inspired project"](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/get-involved/start-an-ea-inspired-project/)
- Vipul Naik's [new article pool](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/new-article-pool.mediawiki) for a list of Wikipedia pages that could be written (disclosure: I work with Vipul)
- There might be ways to search GitHub for EA-related repositories, and finding the issues for those repos
- Peter Hurford's [list of projects](http://peterhurford.tumblr.com/post/142805032066/effective-altruism-project-ideas) (I think intended for himself)
- [Diaspora Project Map](https://namespace.obormot.net/Main/DiasporaProjectMap) ([announcement](https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/fDhy3PXvJ6sjBJQB8/show-lw-diaspora-project-map-and-preregistration-database))
- Various shared housing projects
- A bunch of ideas have been posted in various EA Facebook groups and other comment threads, and I don't know how well those ideas have been aggregated into the lists above

I think database access would also be nice.

For fields to keep track of, I think effort (an estimate of how long it would take to complete the project), prerequisites (both in terms of subject area knowledge and skills), venue, and format would be nice to have.
