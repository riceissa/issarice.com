# Why "cause area" as the unit of analysis?

Back in April 2018, I spent some time trying to understand the hierarchy/structure/classification of cause areas. I did this at the suggestion of Vipul Naik, who wanted to categorize cause areas treated on the [Cause Prioritization Wiki](https://causeprioritization.org/) so that there was more structure to it than that of a jumble of 100+ cause areas, and also generally to make the analysis of cause areas more systematic.

Some of the outputs of that investigation are:

- A [list of existing classifications of philanthropy](https://causeprioritization.org/List_of_classifications_of_philanthropy)
- A [directed acyclic graph of existing cause areas](https://causeprioritization.org/dagitty-model.svg) (where $A \to B$ means "$A$ has $B$ as a sub-cause" or "if I am claiming that I work on $B$, then I can also claim that I am working on $A$")
- A [list of potential properties with which to classify existing cause areas](https://causeprioritization.org/Cause_area_classification)
- A [table of form of altruism vs beneficiary group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l22FA-QVcER1mANhs2id_fp5Sc-RlQc4etHizMoEtDw/edit) ("beneficiary group" and "form of altruism" are two of the "potential properties" in the previous list, so this table crosses these two properties)
- A [generic linkdump and rambling on taxonomies](https://issarice.com/taxonomies)

I came away from the above investigation feeling pretty confused about the nature of cause areas. Given just a description of reality, it didn't seem obvious to me to carve things out into "cause areas" and to take "cause area" as the basic unit of analysis/prioritization.

Some thoughts/intuitions that contribute to this feeling:

- I should mention that there are several meanings of "cause area", as explained by [Owen Cotton-Barratt back in 2014](http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/on-causes/).
- A cause area can try to seem big by lumping together more and more things in the world. Do we compare "animal welfare improvement" against "agent foundations research", or against "technical AI safety work", or against "technical, strategy, or policy work in AI safety", or against "applied mathematics related to futuristic technology"?
- More generally, if we take some basic unit of action like "1 person-year of work" then we can classify these units of work into cause areas. But then we can imagine defining some arbitrary "cause area" that just picks out the most high-value actions can declares it "the most important cause".
- I can imagine some sort of motte-and-bailey argument taking place where the opponent of a cause area picks some ineffective actions within the cause area while a supporter picks effective actions, so they disagree regrading the overall effectiveness of the cause area despite agreeing about the effectiveness of specific actions.

I am curious to hear people's thoughts on this.
