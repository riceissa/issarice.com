# Why "cause area" as the unit of analysis?

Back in April 2018, I spent some time trying to understand the hierarchy/structure/classification of cause areas. I did this at the suggestion of Vipul Naik, who wanted to (1) categorize cause areas treated on the [Cause Prioritization Wiki](https://causeprioritization.org/) so that there was more structure to it than that of a jumble of 100+ cause areas, and (2) make the analysis of cause areas more systematic.

Some of the outputs of that investigation are:

- A [list of existing classifications of philanthropy](https://causeprioritization.org/List_of_classifications_of_philanthropy)
- A [directed acyclic graph of existing cause areas](https://causeprioritization.org/dagitty-model.svg) (where $A \to B$ means "$A$ has $B$ as a sub-cause" or "if I am claiming that I work on $B$, then I can also claim that I am working on $A$")
- A [list of potential properties with which to classify existing cause areas](https://causeprioritization.org/Cause_area_classification)
- A [table of "form of altruism" vs "beneficiary group"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l22FA-QVcER1mANhs2id_fp5Sc-RlQc4etHizMoEtDw/edit) ("form of altruism" and "beneficiary group" are two of the "potential properties" in the previous list, so this table crosses these two properties, resulting in a two-dimensional grid)
- A [generic linkdump and rambling on taxonomies](https://issarice.com/taxonomies)

I came away from the above investigation feeling pretty confused about the nature of cause areas. Given just a description of reality, it didn't seem obvious to me to carve things out into "cause areas" and to take "cause area" as the basic unit of analysis/prioritization.

Some thoughts/intuitions that contribute to this feeling:

- As [explained](http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/on-causes/) by Owen Cotton-Barratt back in 2014, there are at least two meanings of "cause area". My impression is that since then, effective altruists have not really distinguished between these different meanings, which suggests to me that some combination of the following things are happening: (1) the distinction isn't too important in practice; (2) people are using "cause area" as a shorthand for "the established cause areas in effective altruism"; (3) people are confused about what a "cause area" even is, but lack the metacognitive abilities to notice this.
- A cause area can try to "seem" big or small by lumping together more and more things in the world (or alternatively excluding more things from itself). Do we compare "animal welfare improvement" against "agent foundations research", or against "technical AI safety work", or against "technical, strategy, or policy work in AI safety", or against "existential risk reduction", or against "applied mathematics related to futuristic technology"?
- More generally, if we take some basic unit of action like "1 person-year of work" then we can form sets of actions and call those sets "cause areas" (these sets don't necessarily form a partition, i.e. there might be actions contained in multiple causes and actions not contained in any cause). But then we can imagine defining some arbitrary "cause area" that just picks out the most high-value actions can declares it "the most important cause".
- I can imagine some sort of motte-and-bailey argument taking place where the opponent of a cause area picks some ineffective actions within the cause area while a supporter picks effective actions, so they disagree regrading the overall effectiveness of the cause area despite agreeing about the effectiveness of specific actions.
- One way looking at cause areas might be useful is from an evaluator's perspective of "what skills/domain expertise do I need to be able to evaluate specific programs/research topics?" If skillsets tend to "unlock" a bunch of potential programs at once, then there might be a natural-seeming boundary around these programs, which might correspond to our intuitive notion of cause area.
- There is a loose analogy to other situations where reductionism has been useful.
- In practice, Open Philanthropy Project (which is apparently doing cause prioritization) has fixed a list of cause areas, and is prioritizing among much more specific opportunities within those cause areas.

I am curious to hear people's thoughts on this. I would also appreciate pointers to existing discussion (I feel like I've been paying attention, but it seems plausible to me that I've missed some).
