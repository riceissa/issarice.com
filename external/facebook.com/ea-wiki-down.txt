The EA Wiki has been giving me a 403 for several months now. I think I first noticed this in July and sent a message through the contact form on the EA Hub website (https://eahub.org/contact) but never received a response. Is the wiki supposed to be down? Is there a plan to bring it back? If not, why is the link to the wiki still in the EA Hub navigation bar?
