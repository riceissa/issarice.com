The restriction to "full-time AI and machine learning students in any year of their PhD, and to people applying to start a PhD in Fall 2018" is somewhat puzzling to me, considering especially the background of Open Philanthropy's own program officer and technical advisors.

Of the four technical advisors listed for the MIRI grant (http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/machine-intelligence-research-institute-general-support):

- Paul Christiano seems to have done his PhD in theoretical CS https://paulfchristiano.com/
- Jacob Steinhardt is an AI PhD student https://jsteinhardt.wordpress.com/about/
- Chris Olah lists no education on his CV, but lists the Thiel Fellowship https://colah.github.io/cv.pdf
- Dario Amodei completed a PhD in physics http://hertzfoundation.org/fellows/fellow-profile/11149/Dario-Amodei

In addition, Daniel Dewey completed a BS https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Daniel-Dewey.pdf

Jacob seems to be the only one who would meet (or would have met) Open Philanthropy's criteria.

Looking beyond Open Philanthropy, it is possible to find people with even more unconventional backgrounds at e.g. MIRI https://intelligence.org/team/
