This might be the discussion you were thinking of: https://github.com/peterhurford/xventures/issues/69

Some related slides from a talk about LessWrong 2.0: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RJlK5wJw9ybWvQF0gSSBn_7okT9F6KRtjHKbG-b2f1U/edit#slide=id.g1fb897d676_0_54

For LessWrong, I mainly care about the output of specific users and tend to use Wei Dai's script at http://www.ibiblio.org/weidai/lesswrong_user.php (which will most likely stop working once LW 2.0 takes over the domain).

I have some archives of EA Hub profiles, Arbital, and other random stuff. Back in 2014 and maybe 2015 I archived a lot of Quora content of users I liked (Quora disallows the Internet Archive to archive its pages so it seemed quite possible that a lot of content would be irrevocably lost), though this wasn't specifically rationalist/EA content. I have a bookmarklet to archive pages using the Internet Archive and archive.is (https://issarice.com/firefox#bookmarklets) and mostly do that for pages I read and cite (this means I don't have to worry about storage costs, but if the services go away then the archived content also goes away).

One issue I've run into is that people don't want their stuff to be re-posted once gone. Even gwern personally asked me to stop hosting some of his deleted pages (for context, see https://files.issarice.com/gwern/info.html). For social media profiles, I started taking some notes at http://contentcreation.issarice.com/psychology-of-social-media-profile-deletion/ but haven't returned to it recently.

I have more notes at https://issarice.com/digital-preservation but that doesn't talk about content targeting (it's more about the technical difficulties of archiving stuff).
