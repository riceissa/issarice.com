==History==

How did it become a hub?

Executive Director Tyler Emerson and Advocacy Director Michael Anissimov are both located in the Bay Area of California, along with SIAI Research Fellow Eliezer Yudkowsky (since February).

Especially since 2016 or so (possibly earlier?), there has been a considerable amount of debate

"""The reasons for this are not immediately apparent.

"""The theme of the Bay Solstice turned out to be "Hey guys, so people keep coming to the Bay, running on a dream and a promise of community, but that community is not actually there, there's a tiny number of well-connected people who everyone is trying to get time with, and everyone seems lonely and sad. And we don't even know what to do about this." """<ref>Raymond Arnold. [http://lesswrong.com/lw/p1f/notes_from_the_hufflepuff_unconference_part_1/ "Notes from the Hufflepuff Unconference (Part 1)"].

"""4. Ward Street is quickly becoming the center of the rationalist scene in Berkeley. We’re trying to encourage that so that as many people as possible can live near each other and it can feel like more of a community. I’ll be staying there temporarily when I first get to California, and I know a lot of other people on the street and they’re all pretty interesting. Anyway, there’s a house opening up there as the current residents leave, and we’d like to get rationalist-adjacent people to move in. It’s three bedrooms, one bathroom, and it costs $4100/month total. If interested (either in renting the whole house with friends/family, or in just renting one room and hoping two other people want the same), email jsalvatier[at]gmail[dot]com and he can tell you more / help connect interested parties together."""<ref>Scott Alexander.

"Even if you know nothing else, you know to move to San Francisco or New York and hoping something good happens there, rather than sitting around in some dying small town where you know nothing will ever happen and being curious about anything beyond the town is a cultural transgression.

"""Sending people to the Bay

I know meetups causing people to move to the Bay is a controversial topic, but from my perspective, moving to the Bay is one of the best things a person can do in terms of expected impact on the existential risk landscape. It gives people the opportunity to work at aligned organizations, and to be around hundreds of like-minded people, which (in addition to its social benefits) allows people to find collaborators with whom to start new projects and organizations."""<ref>mingyuan.
