While the application of [[Functional decision theory|functional]]/[[Updateless decision theory|updateless]]/[[Timeless decision theory|timeless]] decision theory to decision-making computer programs (where copying, simulating, reading each other's source code, etc. is readily possible) is clear, it is sometimes discussed whether these decision theories have applications to everyday human life.

(That’s just an intuition though since I don’t know how to do the calculations.)" "If we apply UDT to humans, what does it actually say in various real-life situations like voting or contributing to x-risk reduction?"<ref>https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/gX8fcAwk3HGkFyJgk/what-are-the-open-problems-in-human-rationality/answer/jmwunx3PP73GRtuxd</ref> "It feels to me like people in our community aren’t being skeptical enough or pushing back enough on the idea of acausal coordination for humans. I’m kind of confused about this because it seems like a weirder idea and has less good arguments for it than for example the importance of AI risk which does get substantial skepticism and push back."<ref>https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/3iFzaDwoah35ri4aD/how-dangerous-is-it-to-ride-a-bicycle-without-a-helmet/comment/TsGKTyY3CzeuGyFPP</ref> "I sometimes see what I consider to be overly enthusiastic applications of UDT, and as the person most associated with UDT I feel an obligation to push against that."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/jBnX58P8J6HuTCz2g/a-proof-of-occam-s-razor/comment/dJiQxmEBZbBYpJDcL |title=Wei_Dai comments on A Proof of Occam's Razor - LessWrong 2.0 viewer |accessdate=October 3, 2019}}</ref> See also [https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/Knc6wkW6yzD8o5L3c/is-requires-ought#d8afysbsnKtCdL8Rb this comment].
