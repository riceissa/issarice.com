"'''Do the math, then burn the math and go with your gut'''"<ref>Qiaochu Yuan.

LessWrong.</ref> is a procedure for decision-making that has been described by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]].

==History==

July 2008, <ref>Eliezer Yudkowsky. [https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AJ9dX59QXokZb35fk/when-not-to-use-probabilities "When (Not) To Use Probabilities"]. July 23, 2008.</ref>

In October 2011, LessWrong user bentarm gave an outline of the procedure in a comment in the context of the Amanda Knox case. The steps were: "(1) write down a list of all of the relevant facts on either side of the argument. (2) assign numerical weights to each of the facts, according to how much they point you in one direction or another. (3) burn the piece of paper on which you wrote down the facts, and go with your gut." This description was endorsed by Yudkowsky in a follow-up comment. bentarm's comment claims that Yudkowsky described the procedure during summer of 2011.<ref>bentarm.

In December 2016, [[Anna Salamon]] described the procedure parenthetically at the end of a blog post. Salamon described the procedure as follows: "Eliezer once described what I take to be the a similar ritual for avoiding bucket errors, as follows: When deciding which apartment to rent (he said), one should first do out the math, and estimate the number of dollars each would cost, the number of minutes of commute time times the rate at which one values one's time, and so on.  But at the end of the day, if the math says the wrong thing, one should do the right thing anyway."<ref>[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EEv9JeuY5xfuDDSgF/flinching-away-from-truth-is-often-about-protecting-the]</ref>

Of course there is a problem here: going with one’s gut can be an excuse for going with what one wants to believe, and a lot of what enters into my gut belief could be irrelevant to proper Bayesian analysis. There is an appeal to formulas, which is that they seem to be susceptible to outsiders’ checking them for fairness and consistency."
