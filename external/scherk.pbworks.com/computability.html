<ol id="questions">
    <li>Let <em>S</em> be a one-place semirecursive relation on <b>N</b>, and let us attempt to define a partial function <em>f</em>:&nbsp;<b>N</b>&nbsp;→&nbsp;<b>N</b> as follows: if <em>S</em>(<em>n</em>) then <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, and if not <em>S</em>(<em>n</em>) then <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. What is the strongest statement we can make about <em>f</em>?</li>
    <ol>
        <li><em>f</em> is well-defined</li>
        <ul>
            <li>PARTIALLY. Indeed <em>f</em> is well-defined, but we can say something stronger.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><em>f</em> is total</li>
        <ul>
            <li>CORRECT. <em>f</em> is total because exactly one of <em>S</em>(<em>n</em>) or ¬<em>S</em>(<em>n</em>) holds for each <em>n</em>&nbsp;∈&nbsp;<b>N</b> (law of excluded middle).</li>
        </ul>
        <li><em>f</em> is recursive and total (<em>f</em> is a computable total function)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>INCORRECT. <em>S</em> is only semirecursive, so both <em>S</em> and ¬<em>S</em> may end up in an infinite loop.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <li>Let <em>S</em> be a subset of the natural numbers. Which of the following is <em>not</em> equivalent to saying that <em>S</em> is recursively enumerable?</li>
    <ol>
        <li><em>S</em> is the domain of a computable partial function</li>
        <li><em>S</em> can be enumerated in a computable manner as <em>a</em>₀, <em>a</em>₁, <em>a</em>₂, … in increasing order</li>
        <ul>
            <li>CORRECT. This is equivalent to saying <em>S</em> is recursive, and there exist recursively enumerable sets that are not recursive.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><em>S</em> is the range of a computable partial function</li>
        <li>There exists a two-place relation <em>R</em> on <b>N</b> such that <em>x</em>&nbsp;∈&nbsp;<em>S</em> iff ∃<em>t</em>&nbsp;<em>R</em>(<em>x</em>,&nbsp;<em>t</em>)</li>
        <li><em>S</em> is empty or the range of a primitive recursive function</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Let <em>f</em>:&nbsp;<b>N</b>&nbsp;→&nbsp;<b>N</b> be a partial function. Which of the following is <em>not</em> equivalent to saying that <em>f</em> is computable?</li>
    <ol>
        <li><em>f</em> is computable by a Turing machine</li>
        <li><em>f</em> is definable from the basic functions (zero, successor, identity) using the processes of composition, primitive recursion, and minimization</li>
        <li><em>f</em> is computable by a register machine (abacus machine)</li>
        <li><em>f</em> is computable by a program that uses basic operations (clearing, increment, copy) and a bounded loop</li>
        <ul>
            <li>CORRECT. This is equivalent to saying <em>f</em> is primitive recursive, and there exist recursive functions that are not primitive recursive.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <li>What is the strongest statement we can make about the set of all real numbers?</li>
    <ol>
        <li>It is enumerable</li>
        <li>It is recursively enumerable</li>
        <li>It is recursive</li>
        <li>It is primitive recursive</li>
        <li>We cannot say any of the other options</li>
        <ul>
            <li>CORRECT. The weakest statement is enumerability, but <b>R</b> is uncountable so it cannot be enumerated.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <li>What is the strongest statement we can make about the set of even natural numbers?</li>
    <ol>
        <li>It is enumerable</li>
        <li>It is recursively enumerable</li>
        <li>It is recursive</li>
        <li>It is primitive recursive</li>
        <ul>
            <li>CORRECT.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>We cannot say any of the other options</li>
    </ol>
    <li>What is the strongest statement we can make about the set of all natural numbers?</li>
    <ol>
        <li>It is enumerable</li>
        <li>It is recursively enumerable</li>
        <li>It is recursive</li>
        <li>It is primitive recursive</li>
        <ul>
            <li>CORRECT.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>We cannot say any of the other options</li>
    </ol>
    <li>What is the strongest statement we can make about the set of all rational numbers?</li>
    <ol>
        <li>It is enumerable</li>
        <li>It is recursively enumerable</li>
        <li>It is recursive</li>
        <li>It is primitive recursive</li>
        <ul>
            <li>CORRECT.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>We cannot say any of the other options</li>
    </ol>
    <li>What is the strongest statement we can make about the set of all pairs (<i>m</i>,&nbsp;<i>n</i>) such that the <i>m</i>th Turing machine when started with input <i>n</i> halts?</li>
    <ol>
        <li>It is enumerable</li>
        <ul>
            <li>CORRECT.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>It is recursively enumerable</li>
        <li>It is recursive</li>
        <li>It is primitive recursive</li>
        <li>We cannot say any of the other options</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Can a characteristic function for a set of natural numbers be non-total?</li>
    <ol>
        <li>No; for every input natural number, a characteristic function must output 0 or 1 depending on whether the number is in the set or not. This means the characteristic function is always total.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>CORRECT. However, note that there are also positive semicharacteristic functions, which need not be total.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Yes; for instance, the characteristic function of a semirecursive set is only defined for some inputs.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Which of the following operations are the semirecursive relations <em>not</em> closed under?</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Conjunction (logical AND)</li>
        <li>Disjunction (logical OR)</li>
        <li>Negation (logical NOT)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>CORRECT.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Bounded universal quantification</li>
        <li>Bounded existential quantification</li>
        <li>Existential quantification (not necessarily bounded)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>INCORRECT. A semirecursive relation already can be written in the form ∃t&nbsp;<i>R</i>(<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>t</i>) for some recursive relation <i>R</i>. Intuitively, adding on more existential quantifiers at the beginning doesn't change the "kind" of relation. More carefully, if we have <i>S</i>(<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>) iff ∃t&nbsp;<i>R</i>(<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>,&nbsp;<i>t</i>) for some recursive relation <i>R</i>, then we can write the relation ∃y S(x,y) as ∃M ∃y&lt;M ∃t&lt;M R(x,y,t), where ∃y&lt;M ∃t&lt;M R(x,y,t) is recursive (as it only uses bounded quantification). In other words, we can combine the two unbounded existential quantifiers into a single unbounded "upper bound" and use bounded existential quantifiers for the rest.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <li>What information does a single instruction in a Turing machine use? (Alternatively, what are the inputs to the transition function of a Turing machine?)</li>
    <ol>
        <li>A symbol</li>
        <li>A symbol and a state</li>
        <li>A symbol and an action</li>
        <ul>
            <li>CORRECT.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>A symbol, a state, and an action</li>
        <li>A symbol, two states, and an action</li>
        <ul>
            <li>INCORRECT. This is what a full instruction looks like, but only the symbol and one of the states are used; the other state and the action are the <em>outputs</em> of the transition function.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <li>Which of the following is an incorrect explanation of why there is a countable number of Turing-computable functions?</li>
    <ol>
        <li>We can encode each Turing machine by a list of quadruples (in-state, scanned symbol, output action, out-state)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>INCORRECT. This is the most direct way to show that there are a countable number of Turing-computable functions.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Turing machines are basically computer programs, whose source code can be written as finite strings of a finite alphabet; therefore, there are a countable number of them</li>
        <ul>
            <li>PARTIALLY. This explanation works, but it sort of appeals to the Church–Turing thesis.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Turing-computable functions are equivalent to partial recursive functions, and there are a countable number of partial recursive functions.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>PARTIALLY. While this is not wrong, the equivalence of Turing computability and recursiveness is sort of a more advanced fact (also, does the proof the equivalence use countability anywhere?).</li>
        </ul>
        <li>A Turing machine comes with an infinitely long tape which is countable. At any stage during the computation, only finitely many squares on the tape have a symbol written on them. Therefore, there are a countable number of Turing machines.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>CORRECT. This explains why the <em>configuration</em> of a stage of computation is finite, but doesn't explain why there are countably many Turing machines.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <li>Let <i>f</i>: N → N be a computable partial function. What can we say about the graph relation G of f, defined by G(x,y) iff f(x) = y?</li>
    <ol>
        <li>G is partial recursive</li>
        <li>G is recursive</li>
        <li>G is semirecursive</li>
        <ul>
            <li>CORRECT.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Nothing; we cannot in general conclude anything about G</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Let f: N → N be a partial function. Suppose the graph relation G of f, defined by G(x,y) iff f(x) = y, is a semirecursive relation. What can we say about f?</li>
    <ol>
        <li>f is primitive recursive</li>
        <li>f is partial recursive</li>
        <ul>
            <li>CORRECT.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>f is recursive and total</li>
        <li>f is semirecursive</li>
        <ul>
            <li>INCORRECT. It does not make sense to ask whether a partial function is semirecursive (we can only ask this for relations and sets).</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Nothing; we cannot in general conclude anything about G</li>
    </ol>
    <li>If f : N<sup>k</sup> → N is a k-place partial recursive function, then the result of applying the minimization operator (also called the μ operator) to f is</li>
    <ol>
        <li>A (k-1)-place partial recursive function</li>
        <ul>
            <li>CORRECT.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>A k-place partial recursive function</li>
        <li>A (k+1)-place partial recursive function</li>
        <li>A subset of N<sup>k-1</sup></li>
        <li>A subset of N<sup>k</sup></li>
        <li>A subset of N<sup>k+1</sup></li>
        <li>A natural number</li>
