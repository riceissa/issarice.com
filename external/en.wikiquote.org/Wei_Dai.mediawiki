* I do have some early role models. I recall wanting to be a real-life version of the fictional "Sandor Arbitration Intelligence at the Zoo" (from Vernor Vinge's novel A Fire Upon the Deep) who in the story is known for consistently writing the clearest and most insightful posts on the Net. And then there was Hal Finney who probably came closest to an actual real-life version of Sandor at the Zoo, and Tim May who besides inspiring me with his vision of cryptoanarchy was also a role model for doing early retirement from the tech industry and working on his own interests/causes.

* Here's my experience. I applied to just [[wikipedia:Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and my state university (University of Washington). I got on MIT's waiting list but was ultimately not accepted, so went to UW. I would certainly have gone to MIT had I been accepted, but my thinking now is that if I did that, I would not have had enough free time in college to write [[wikipedia:Crypto++|Crypto++]] and think about anonymous protocols, [[wikipedia:Multiverse#Max Tegmark's four levels|Tegmark's multiverse]], [[wikipedia:Anthropic principle|anthropic reasoning]], etc., and these spare-time efforts have probably done more for my "career" than the MIT name or what I might have learned there.

* [By the way], since you are advising high school students and undergrads, I suggest that you mention to them that they can start being independent researchers before they graduate from college. For example I came up with my b-money idea (a precursor to [[wikipedia:Bitcoin|Bitcoin]]) as an undergrad, and was also already thinking about some of the questions that would eventually lead to [updateless decision theory].

==Quotes about Dai==

* Yes, you're a freak and nobody but you and a few other freaks can ever get any useful thinking done
** Eliezer Yudkowsky, in a [https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jCSLbQvWz8j4Mwcar/what-we-re-losing#KrgHNaDG5Sh5DSgbX discussion thread] on ''[[wikipedia:LessWrong|LessWrong]]'', May 2011

* Most people do not spontaneously try to solve the <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[wikipedia:Friendly artificial intelligence|friendly artificial intelligence]]</nowiki> (FAI)]</nowiki> problem. If they're spontaneously doing something, they try to solve the AI problem. If we're talking about sort of 'who's made interesting progress on FAI problems without being a Singularity Institute Eliezer supervised person,' then I would have to say: Wei Dai.

* I think you're a much better writer & thinker than me
