==Quotes about Vassar==

* I am personally convinced that the LW Sequences / AI to Zombies gave me something, and gave something similar to others I know, and that hanging out in person with Eliezer Yudkowsky, Michael Vassar, Carl Shulman, Nick Bostrom, and others gave me more of that same thing; a “same thing” that included e.g. actually trying to figure it out, making beliefs pay rent in anticipated experience; using arithmetic to entangle different pieces of my beliefs; and so on.

* One of the most brilliant people I have ever met is Michael Vassar.
: I first ran into him at the Transvision 2003 Conference, just over three years ago. I was sitting next to my sister in a gorgeous auditorium at Yale, and we were watching the opening session of the conference - a debate between Gregory Stock, a transhumanist, and George Annas, who objected to genetic modifications to the human body. At the end of the talk, during the Q&A session, Vassar stood up and asked a question, which was more like a rebuttal, to George Annas - he pointed out that animal experiments have shown that artificial selection can rapidly produce results, like stronger bodies and longer lifespans, so what is the point of restricting genetic modifications, when they can already be achieved so simply? (Paraphrasing.)
