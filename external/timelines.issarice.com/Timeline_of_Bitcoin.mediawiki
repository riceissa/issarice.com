| 1976–2002 || Background research || The key advances in public-key cryptography, proof-of-work systems, etc., are made during this period.

|-
| 2008–2010 || Early days of Bitcoin || Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper is published, the Bitcoin client is released, and some "firsts" take place, like the first trade for fiat money and first trade for a good. Satoshi Nakamoto is still around during this period.
|-
| 2011–2012 || Continued development || Satoshi Nakamoto disappears, but Bitcoin growth continues. Silk Road, BitPay, and Coinbase all launch during this period.

* TODO Add more events about exchange rate changes
* TODO Add CVEs and other incidents related to security and bad transactions
* TODO silkroad?
* TODO "Historically it was not required to include a fee for every transaction. A large portion of miners would mine transactions with no fee given that they had enough "priority". Today, low priority is mostly used as an indicator for spam transactions and almost all miners expect every transaction to include a fee. Today miners choose which transactions to mine only based on fee-rate." https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_Fee When was this "historical" period?
* TODO Fix Bitcoin/bitcoin capitalization. "Some people differentiate between Bitcoin capitalized, as the token, and bitcoin lowercase, as the network." https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/business/all-about-bitcoin-the-mysterious-digital-currency.html And: 'By the way, I’m using capitalized “Infocoin” to refer to the protocol and general concept, and lowercase “infocoin” to refer to specific denominations of the currency. A similar useage is common, though not universal, in the Bitcoin world.' http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works/ And: "There is no uniform convention for bitcoin capitalization. Some sources use Bitcoin, capitalized, to refer to the technology and network and bitcoin, lowercase, to refer to the unit of account.[25] The Wall Street Journal,[26] The Chronicle of Higher Education,[27] and the Oxford English Dictionary[24] advocate use of lowercase bitcoin in all cases, which this article follows." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Etymology_and_orthography
