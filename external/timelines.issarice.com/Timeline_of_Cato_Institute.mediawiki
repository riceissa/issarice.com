==Meta information on the timeline==

===How the timeline was built===

The initial version of the timeline was written by [[User:Issa|Issa Rice]].

Issa likes to work locally and track changes with Git, so the revision history on this wiki only shows changes in bulk. To see more incremental changes, refer to the [https://github.com/riceissa/issarice.com/commits/master/external/timelines.issarice.com/Timeline_of_Cato_Institute.mediawiki commit history].

{{funding info}} is available.
