This is a '''timeline of Wei Dai publications'''. The timeline takes a broad view of publications that includes blog posts and mailing list posts.

==Full timeline==

Comment counts are as of February 15, 2018.

For mailing list posts, the main inclusion criterion is that the initial post in a thread is made by Wei. This will probably miss some substantive posts in other threads, but I'm not sure how to quickly identify those posts without spending much more time.

==Meta information on the timeline==

===How the timeline was built===

The initial version of the timeline was written by [[User:Issa|Issa Rice]].

{{funding info}} is available.

===Feedback and comments===

Feedback for the timeline can be provided at the following places:

* FIXME

===What the timeline is still missing===

* There are some good comment threads that involve Wei on LW, EA Forum, Medium, and IAFF. I think some of these should be included. Some of these are now listed at https://causeprioritization.org/List_of_discussions_between_Paul_Christiano_and_Wei_Dai
* [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/crypto-optimization/ZjtgKWg8AnA this email] mentions him posting to "the NIST SHA-3 forum".

===Timeline update strategy===

I think the new stuff is posted on [https://www.lesswrong.com/users/wei_dai LessWrong].
