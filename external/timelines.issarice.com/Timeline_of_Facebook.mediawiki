! Time period !! Key developments at Facebook
|-
| February 2004{{snd}}September 2006 || Facebook gradually enlarges the set of people who are allowed to register, starting from [[w:Harvard University|Harvard University]] only in February 2004, then gradually expanding to more US universities, then moving to international student networks, and finally switching to open registration in September 2006: anybody who is at least 13 and has a valid email address can sign up.
|-
| September 2006 onward || Even as Facebook's userbase keeps increasing, the eligibility requirements for Facebook remain largely the same. At some point, Facebook starts allowing people to register with either an email address or a mobile phone, thereby making it possible for people who do not have email addresses to register.

{| class="sortable wikitable"
! Time period !! Key developments at Facebook
|-
| 2005 onward, but largely concentrated September 2006–September 2009 ||Facebook develops some of the core social infrastructure that would come to define the user experience for many years to come, starting with photos and the ability to tag friends in them (October and December 2005), Facebook's News Feed (September 2006), and then proceeding to [[w:Facebook Platform|Facebook Platform]] in May 2007, an attempt to get developers to create applications for use within Facebook. The ability to [[w:@-tag|@-tag]] friends in posts and comments is introduced in September 2009.
|-
| Concentrated 2009–2011 || Facebook works on becoming the "social layer" of the web, with the (now deprecated) name [[w:Facebook Connect|Facebook Connect]], that allows Facebook's like buttons to be displayed on external websites, and also allows them to use Facebook for logins.
|-
| Concentrated 2012 onward, with some early moves in 2010 and 2011 || Facebook shifts attention to mobile phones. At the low end of the market, this includes initiatives such as [[w:Facebook Zero|Facebook Zero]] and [[w:Facebook for SIM|Facebook for SIM]]. At the high end, this includes development and improvement of iOS and Android apps, as well as initiatives such as [[w:Facebook Home|Facebook Home]] and [[w:Facebook Paper|Facebook Paper]] (the latter, in January 2014, is the first product of Facebook Creative Labs, Facebook's in-house initiative for small teams to work on standalone mobile apps). Facebook also acquires a number of mobile-focused companies, such as [[w:Instagram|Instagram]] and [[w:WhatsApp|WhatsApp]], and fails to acquire [[w:Snapchat|Snapchat]]. The company's vision evolves to being a family of interconnected apps rather than a single standalone product, and this vision is explicitly articulated at the 2015 F8 conference.<ref name=f8-2015-big-picture/>
|-
| Late 2011 onward || Facebook reimagines some of its core infrastructure, replacing the profile and wall with the new Timeline, and replacing search with [[w:Facebook Graph Search|Facebook Graph Search]]. A plan to significantly redesign the News Feed, announced March 2013, is abandoned a few months later.
|-
| 2013 onward || Facebook moves more aggressively into [[w:Twitter|Twitter]] territory: it launches support for [[w:hashtag|hashtag]]s and hashtag-based search, and also introduces trending topics.
|-
| 2014 onward, picking up steam in 2015 and 2016 || Facebook starts making a new set of changes to its news feed, driven by the Feed Quality Program. More so than previous sets of changes, new changes are based on extensive efforts to gather feedback, including in-person feedback from focus groups and more large-scale surveys. The changes include more explicit identification of hoaxes and the greater use of signals such as time spent viewing a piece of content in the feed and time spent reading the article off Facebook. Machine learning and AI techniques are also used increasingly in the service of improving feed quality.
|-
| 2015 onward, with major rollout in early 2016 || Facebook expands aggressively into live-streaming with the launch of [[w:Facebook Live|Facebook Live]].
