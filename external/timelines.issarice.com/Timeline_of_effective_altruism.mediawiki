==Meta information on the timeline==

===How the timeline was built===

The initial version of the timeline was written by [[User:Issa|Issa Rice]] (and probably also some editors on Wikipedia, who wrote the parts Issa quoted from other Wikipedia articles; unfortunately the version on Wikipedia was deleted so it's hard to check where the quotes came from).

Several rows are taken from [[Timeline of wild animal suffering]].

<!-- {{funding info}} is available. -->
