TODO:

- what were rob mather and andrew garner doing before AMF? very little info of them anywhere.
- when was the AMF malaria advisory group established?
- add when TLYCS added AMF as a recommended charity.
- "changes to the distribution guidelines and post-distribution checkup rules" -- kinda hard to find exact dates around this, imo.
- keep track of max nets distributed per distribution?
- "inclusion in standard lists of match-eligible charities"
- tax deductibility in Canada
- tax deductibility event for another group of countries?
- post-distribution checkup interval changes
- when did it hire the two other people? and how many people does it have anyway?
- the other occurrences of "madness against malaria". During which years did this happen? This tweet https://twitter.com/AgainstMalaria/status/16493837998 shows it happening in June 2010, in addition to the original late 2006 - early 2007.
- "The Big Varsity Match 2017" fundraising event
