This is a '''timeline of Carl Shulman publications'''. This timeline covers only publicly published work; Shulman apparently has "a giant folder of hundreds of blog post drafts to throw interesting ideas, citations, and links to" that this timeline does not cover.<ref name="research_advice_doc" />

==Full timeline==

The "Comment count" column applies only to blog posts and relies on the comment counting provided by Disqus, Blogger, LessWrong, etc. (as the case may be) rather than manually counting up the comments. The column is blind to the identity of the commenter (e.g. a comment by Shulman himself counts as a comment, as well as any uncaught spam). The comment counts are as of June 5, 2017.

The "Word count" column was produced by the simple process of copying the text of the post into a buffer in Vim and counting with [http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/editing.html#g_CTRL-G <code>g CTRL-G</code>]. In the handful of cases checked, this matched the output of GNU <code>wc</code>'s [http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/zesty/en/man1/wc.1.html <code>wc -w</code>]. Blockquotes, footnotes, and tables were included in the count to make the process easier. For PDFs, a text dump was created by attempting to select all text with <code>CTRL-A</code>, in two PDF readers, Chrome on Linux and either PDF.js or Atril (in parentheses). For posts that were crossposted between *Reflective Disequilibrium* and another blog, the one on the former was used. Word counts are as of July 5, 2017.

==Meta information on the timeline==

===How the timeline was built===

The original timeline was written by [[User:Issa|Issa Rice]]. [[User:Vipul|Vipul Naik]] provided funding through a stipend but no specific task payment.

The timeline was constructed by going through both formal publications and blog posts in various venues with substantive content.

On July 5, 2017 word counts were added at the [http://lesswrong.com/lw/7ob/timeline_of_carl_shulman_publications/dv11 suggestion of gwern].

===Feedback and comments===

Feedback for the timeline can be provided at the following places:

* [http://lesswrong.com/lw/7ob/timeline_of_carl_shulman_publications/dv11 LessWrong comment announcing the timeline]
