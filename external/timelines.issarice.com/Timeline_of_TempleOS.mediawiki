TODO:

* names: Doors, Davos, J, LoseThos. When did each name come along?

* https://archive.fo/vNnwS

* When did terry move to las vegas?

* the motherboard piece also mentions terry living in washington and some other states i think. when did that happen?

* https://web.archive.org/web/20031203025206/http://www.tdavis.hare.com/

* "In Phoenix, they put some RAF james bond charector in prison (mental hospital) with me... That tripped me out. At one point I feared for my life as I was surrounded by prisoners and the staff wasn't near. Anyway, I eventually befriended the guy and he told me stories of prison riots in Ireland (northern) where the prisoners completely destroyed the facility." -- is this where the IRA stuff comes from?

* where is this from? "Let's get something straight... Mel was a sympathy fuck sort of... with attractive women, I'm not totally impotent... Off the meds, that is... Fucken bastard doctors want to exterminate the Lunitic fringe but the abuse makes us more potent in other ways. At the store recently I had to sneak-out with a hard-on a couple times. I'm older now suffering, I think from age, however. Hard lesson is don't do sympathy fucks... makes both people miserable. That's a homosexaul sort of thing--going for unattractive women out of kindness. (I've decided.) There's a fundamental law of dating and it's binary." https://boards.4chan.org/g/thread/59444682#p59450101
