TODO:

* names: Doors, Davos, J, LoseThos. When did each name come along?

* https://archive.fo/vNnwS

* When did terry move to las vegas?

* the motherboard piece also mentions terry living in washington and some other states i think. when did that happen?

* https://web.archive.org/web/20031203025206/http://www.tdavis.hare.com/

* "In Phoenix, they put some RAF james bond charector in prison (mental hospital) with me... That tripped me out. At one point I feared for my life as I was surrounded by prisoners and the staff wasn't near. Anyway, I eventually befriended the guy and he told me stories of prison riots in Ireland (northern) where the prisoners completely destroyed the facility." -- is this where the IRA stuff comes from?

* "Praise God for, helium voices." https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6260454
  Elsewhere he also mentions getting high off gas fumes.

* " I always have a captive audience. They take notes as I write. I'm like a professor on an overhead and I repeat every semester."
  """It can seem less glorious repeating the same stuff. You get better ... better analogies for your sales pitch if it's the operating system...

repeating seems depressing, but its not.

All the disciples went a preached over and over in all the cities. Same thing, many times.

God is nice and says new stuff.

As good as life gets is being God's preacher... dont call my rabbi, though... I'm confused."""

""">>59565763
The new thread part implies that Terry smashed the new bird as soon as it showed up, which is not what happened

There's a lof of the HARE doc that's missing, like his relationship with Ira"""
