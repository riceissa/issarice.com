| 2011 || || || {{W|Andrew Ng}} launches "the Deep Learning project at Google".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/05/neuro-artificial-intelligence/all/ |title=The Man Behind the Google Brain: Andrew Ng and the Quest for the New AI |publisher=Wired Enterprise |date=May 7, 2013 |author=Daniela Hernandez |accessdate=May 12, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601214246/http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/05/neuro-artificial-intelligence/all/ |archivedate=June 1, 2013 |dead-url=yes}}</ref> This project would eventually become Google Brain.
|-
| 2011 || early in the year || || {{W|Jeff Dean}} runs into {{W|Andrew Ng}} at a Google campus microkitchen. Ng tells Dean about Project Marvin, an internal effort to experiment with neural networks. Project Marvin was eventually referred to as Google Brain.<ref name="great-ai-awakening">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/magazine/the-great-ai-awakening.html |author=Gideon Lewis-Kraus |title=The Great A.I.

|-
| 2011 || {{dts|November 13}} || || A ''{{W|New York Times}}'' article from this day covering {{W|Google X}} mentions that {{W|Andrew Ng}} is at Google X.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/technology/at-google-x-a-top-secret-lab-dreaming-up-the-future.html |date=November 13, 2011 |publisher=[[wikipedia:The New York Times|The New York Times]] |title=At Google X, a Top-Secret Lab Dreaming Up the Future |first1=Claire Cain |last1=Miller |first2=Nick |last2=Bilton |accessdate=May 12, 2018}}</ref>

| 2012 || {{dts|December}} || || {{W|Ray Kurzweil}} joins Google as a director of engineering.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/14/ray-kurzweil-joins-google-as-engineering-director-focusing-on-machine-learning-and-language-tech/ |first=Colleen |last=Taylor |date=December 15, 2012 |publisher=TechCrunch |title=Ray Kurzweil Joins Google In Full-Time Engineering Director Role; Will Focus On Machine Learning, Language Processing |accessdate=May 13, 2018}}</ref> When asked whether he is trying to build an artificial "Google Brain" as part of {{W|Jeff Dean}}'s program, Kurzweil replies that "Jeff Dean is one of my collaborators".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2013/04/kurzweil-google-ai/ |title=How Ray Kurzweil Will Help Google Make the Ultimate AI Brain |date=April 25, 2013 |first=Steven |last=Levy |publisher=[[wikipedia:WIRED|WIRED]] |accessdate=May 13, 2018}}</ref> It's not clear whether he was actually part of what would become Google Brain.
|-
| 2012 || {{Dts|June 26}} || || A blog post by {{W|Jeff Dean}} and {{W|Andrew Ng}} is published on the official Google blog. The post covers work done by the two at Google; in particular it announces the paper "Building High-level Features Using Large Scale Unsupervised Learning", which has been called "the cat paper". Neither the blog post nor the paper mentions a "Google Brain" (either as a project name or a team name), but this work was done by the Google Brain project.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/using-large-scale-brain-simulations-for.html |title=Using large-scale brain simulations for machine learning and A.I. |first1=Jeff |last1=Dean |first2=Andrew |last2=Ng |publisher=Official Google Blog |accessdate=May 12, 2018}}</ref><ref name="great-ai-awakening" />
|-
| ? || || || {{W|Andrew Ng}} leaves Google to lead Baidu's AI team.<ref name="great-ai-awakening" />
|-
| 2013 || {{Dts|March}} || || Google hires {{W|Geoffrey Hinton}} and acquires DNNresearch Inc., the neural networks company started by Hinton and two of his graduate students, Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://media.utoronto.ca/media-releases/u-of-t-neural-networks-start-up-acquired-by-google/ |date=March 12, 2013 |author=U of T Media |title=Media Room & Blue Book – University of Toronto |accessdate=May 13, 2018}}</ref> The news reporting does not mention what Hinton would be working on at Google, but presumably he joined what would become Google Brain.
|-
| 2013 or 2014? || || || Google Brain graduates out of Google X and into "the broader research organization" (does that mean Google Research?). At this point the Google Brain team has fewer than 10 people.<ref name="great-ai-awakening" />
|-
| 2015 || {{Dts|November 9}} || || Google open-sources {{W|TensorFlow}}, a machine learning library. "TensorFlow was originally a project developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/09/google-open-sources-the-machine-learning-tech-behind-google-photos-search-smart-reply-and-more/ |date=November 10, 2015 |publisher=TechCrunch |title=Google Open-Sources The Machine Learning Tech Behind Google Photos Search, Smart Reply And More |first=Sarah |last=Perez |accessdate=May 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://plus.google.com/+VincentVanhoucke/posts/4VFgjmRHnkQ |title=Very proud to be open-sourcing TensorFlow, Google's newest Deep Learning fram... |first=Vincent |last=Vanhoucke |quote=TensorFlow is what we use every day in the Google Brain team, and while it's still very early days and there are a ton of rough edges to be ironed out, I'm excited about the opportunity to build a community of researchers, developers and infrastructure providers around it. |accessdate=May 17, 2018}}</ref> The TensorFlow preliminary white paper is also published on this day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://download.tensorflow.org/paper/whitepaper2015.pdf |title=TensorFlow: Large-Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Distributed Systems |author=Abadi et al. |accessdate=May 17, 2018}}</ref>
|-
| 2016 || {{dts|February}} || || Greg Corrado and Jeff Dean of Google Brain approach Macduff Hughes, the director of Google Translate. Corrado and Dean tell Hughes that Google Translate could be overhauled with a neural network-based approach to machine translation by the end of 2016.<ref name="great-ai-awakening" />
|-
| 2016 || {{dts|April 8}} || || The Google Brain team page is shared on {{W|Hacker News}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11451916 |title=Google Brain Team |website=Hacker News |accessdate=May 12, 2018}}</ref> This is possibly the first verifiable date on which "Google Brain" is used as a team name.
|-

|-
| 2016 || {{Dts|September 27}} || || The {{W|Google Neural Machine Translation}} system is announced on the Google AI Blog. The post is written by research scientists on the Google Brain team, and the post acknowledges the Google Brain team for contributions to the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/09/a-neural-network-for-machine.html |title=A Neural Network for Machine Translation, at Production Scale |publisher=Google AI Blog |first1=Quoc V. |last1=Le |first2=Mike |last2=Schuster |date=September 27, 2016 |accessdate=May 13, 2018}}</ref>
