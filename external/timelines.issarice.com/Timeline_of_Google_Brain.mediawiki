|-
| 2011 || early in the year || || {{W|Jeff Dean}} runs into {{W|Andrew Ng}} at a Google campus microkitchen. Ng tells Dean about Project Marvin, an internal effort to experiment with neural networks. Dean begins working on the project during his "[[wikipedia:Google#Innovation Time Off|20 percent time]]". Soon Dean brings in Greg Corrado and Ng invites one of his graduate students, Quoc Le. Project Marvin would eventually be referred to as Google Brain.<ref name="great-ai-awakening">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/magazine/the-great-ai-awakening.html |author=Gideon Lewis-Kraus |title=The Great A.I.
