==Workshops==

I haven't found numbers for other years, but their [http://rationality.org/ home page] says 909 workshop alumni on 2017-07-12. The [http://rationality.org/workshops/faq#how-many-people-will-be-at-my-workshop workshop FAQ] says "Workshop size varies, but most are around 32 participants. Some are up to 60 participants." So that means maybe around 28 workshops have been conducted in all? It looks like older workshops only had 25 participants, so that could mean up to 36 workshops in all. And there have been at least 20 workshops, from those listed below.

==Meta information on the timeline==

===How the timeline was built===

The initial version of the timeline was written by [[User:Issa|Issa Rice]].

{{funding info}} is available.

===What the timeline is still missing===

* CFAR apparently ran a rationality dojo; any more info on this?<ref name="salamon-lower-cost-and-europe" />
* Timeline should probably mention some co-founders/early people, like Julia Galef, Andrew Critch, and Eliezer Yudkowsky

===Timeline update strategy===
