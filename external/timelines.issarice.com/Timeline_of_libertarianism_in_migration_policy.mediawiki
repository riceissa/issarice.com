After I joined EconLog in 2005, I suddenly had an ideal forum to share my views on immigration. [â€¦] Once I became a blogger, I finally had a home for my previously transient thoughts.

I believed in open borders over a decade before I started blogging, but blogging made my open borders advocacy deeper and clearer."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://openborders.info/blog/my-path-to-open-borders/ |title=My Path to Open Borders |date=January 2, 2015 |author=Bryan Caplan |publisher=Open Borders: The Case |accessdate=September 1, 2017}}</ref>
