| Large emphasis<ref>From ''{{w|Poor Economics}}'': "Jeffrey Sachs, adviser to the United Nations, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University in New York City, and one such expert, has an answer to all these questions: Poor countries are poor because they are hot, infertile, malaria infested, often landlocked; this makes it hard for them to be productive without an initial large investment to help them deal with these endemic problems. But they cannot pay for the investments precisely because they are poorâ€”they are in what economists call a 'poverty trap.' Until something is done about these problems, neither free markets nor democracy will do very much for them."</ref>
