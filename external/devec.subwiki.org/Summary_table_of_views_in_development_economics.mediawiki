This is a '''summary table of views on development economics'''.

==Table==

The "Background beliefs" group of columns gather some relevant background beliefs and assumptions. Roughly, they give a lens through which to view development economics.

The "Level of emphasis on explanations for differential growth" group of columns together respond to questions like:

* Has growth failed?
* Why has growth failed?
* What must poor countries do to achieve growth?
* Why are poor people poor?
* Do the poor get poorer?

More factors for growth (quoted from Aghion and Howitt, ''The Economics of Growth''): "Why have other poor countries not also joined the convergence club? Is this due to poor geographical conditions? Or to the absence of institutions to protect private investments and entrepreneurship? Or to the inability of poor countries to attract credit, diversify risk, or finance infrastructure? Or to insufficient human capital?"

| Large emphasis<ref>From ''{{w|Poor Economics}}'': "Jeffrey Sachs, adviser to the United Nations, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University in New York City, and one such expert, has an answer to all these questions: Poor countries are poor because they are hot, infertile, malaria infested, often landlocked; this makes it hard for them to be productive without an initial large investment to help them deal with these endemic problems. But they cannot pay for the investments precisely because they are poorâ€”they are in what economists call a 'poverty trap.' Until something is done about these problems, neither free markets nor democracy will do very much for them."</ref>
