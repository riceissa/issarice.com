==Notes/scratch work==

"Four multilateral methods are considered in detail: (1) Walsh, (2) EKS, (3) Van Yzeren, and (4) Geary-Khamis. Each method goes beyond the binary procedures of Chapter 4 by drawing upon price and quantity data of all countries simultaneously in aggregating up from the category level. They all are base country invariant, and have the transitivity property, and can be adapted to a form that gives additive consistency. The EKS method meets the factor-reversal test. The Geary-Khamis method also satisfies the test at the GDP level. Only in a purely definitional sense (that is, by deriving either the PPPs or the quantity index indirectly) can the Walsh and Van Yzeren methods and the Geary-Khamis subaggretates be said also to meet the test."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/199981467988893189/pdf/multi-page.pdf |title=World Bank Document - multi-page.pdf |accessdate=November 3, 2017}}</ref>

What methods do the following use?

* OECD
* Eurostat
* World Bank
* IDB

chained/chain-linked vs fixed-base versions for each of the above? [https://www.oecd.org/std/prices-ppp/2424597.pdf]{{rp|6}} [https://www.um.edu.mt/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/149266/food_imports_update.pdf]{{rp|7}}

I think there's also bilateral vs multilateral versions of the above?

What parameters do each ''p'' (price) or ''q'' (quantity) variables take? I have seen time period (usually ''t'' or ''n''), commodity/basic heading (''c'' or ''i''), country (''j'').

A lower bound on the number of price indices: "But Walsh (1901) and Fisher (1922) presented hundreds of functional forms for bilateral price indexes".<ref name="diewert-index-numbers" /> My current understanding is that only a handful are commonly used in practice, perhaps because the others fail to satisfy nice properties.

The multilateral indices can be divided into those that use binary comparisons (i.e. make use of some binary index) and ones that don't. Examples of the former are EKS and Van Yzeren. Examples of the latter are Walsh indices (apparently there are multiple).<ref name="icrgp1982">{{cite web |url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/974171468766774952/pdf/multi-page.pdf |title=World Product and Income: International Comparisons of Real Gross Product (United Nations International Comparison Project Phase III) |year=1982 |first1=Irving B. |last1=Kravis |first2=Alan |last2=Heston |first3=Robert |last3=Summers |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |accessdate=November 5, 2017}}</ref>{{rp|76, 77}} This is probably why Walsh is listed as both a binary and a multilateral index: there is some binary formulation, and you can probably generalize it for multilateral comparison, but that multilateral index does not use the binary comparisons from the binary version. (My guess at what's going on.)

For multilateral indices, there is the question of what bilateral index it reduces to when the number of countries goes down to two.

A bilateral/binary index works just as well for locations as time periods. You just need as inputs two price vectors and two quantity vectors (where the coordinates are the different goods). The two price vectors can be two periods or two countries.

Balk lists the following multilateral methods: GEKS, Van IJzeren, Gerardi, WFBS (weighted Fisher blended system), WDOS (Diewert's Own Share system), YKS (Kurabayashi and Sakuma), Q-YKS, GK, EWGK (equally weighted GK method), KS-S (Kurabayashi and Sakuma), SRK (Sakuma, Rao, and Kurabayashi), Sergueev, Gerardi, Iklé, Rao.<ref name="balk-2001" />

One taxonomy of multilateral indices is given by Hill.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roiw.org/1997/49.pdf |author=Robert J.
