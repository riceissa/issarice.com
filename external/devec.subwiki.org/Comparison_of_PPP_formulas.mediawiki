This page is a '''comparison of PPP formulas'''. A [[PPP formula]] is used to calculate price matrices.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity#Measurement_issues |title=Purchasing power parity &sect; Measurement issues |accessdate=October 27, 2017 |publisher=English Wikipedia}}</ref>

"Four multilateral methods are considered in detail: (1) Walsh, (2) EKS, (3) Van Yzeren, and (4) Geary-Khamis. Each method goes beyond the binary procedures of Chapter 4 by drawing upon price and quantity data of all countries simultaneously in aggregating up from the category level. They all are base country invariant, and have the transitivity property, and can be adapted to a form that gives additive consistency. The EKS method meets the factor-reversal test. The Geary-Khamis method also satisfies the test at the GDP level. Only in a purely definitional sense (that is, by deriving either the PPPs or the quantity index indirectly) can the Walsh and Van Yzeren methods and the Gery-Khamis subaggretates be said also to meet the test."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/199981467988893189/pdf/multi-page.pdf |title=World Bank Document - multi-page.pdf |accessdate=November 3, 2017}}</ref>
