This guide explores ways to navigate to URLs more efficiently inside a web browser, with a focus on the Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers. It does not cover bookmarks or custom keyword searches, as these are often covered in other guides. This guide emphasizes typing words to navigate rather than clicking and navigating menus.<ref>Ben Kuhn. [https://www.benkuhn.net/autocomplete "Autocomplete as an interface"]. September 2015.

==Summary table==

The following table summarizes the various strategies for navigation covered in this article, and helps you decide which strategies to use in a given situation.

{| class="sortable wikitable"
|-
! Strategy !! What you need to remember about a page !! Pros !! Cons/caveats
|-
| Address bar
| A word that appears in the URL or title
| Easy to use and searching is fast
| In Google Chrome, the set of URLs that are searched is limited to those visited in the last 3 days or visited at least 4 times or typed at least once

==Steps==

===Basic search using the address bar (omnibox or Awesome Bar)===

The address bar (or URL/keyword navigation bar) at the top of the browser displays the current webpage's URL. Most of the time when navigating to a specific page that you have visited in the past, you will be typing words from the URL or title of the page into this bar and selecting from the suggestions given by the browser. In Google Chrome, this bar is called the omnibox. In Mozilla Firefox, it is called the Awesome Bar.

# Figure out what you remember about a page. If you can remember words from the URL or title of the page, that makes searching much easier (because the URL and title are what the browser remembers about the page). If you can only remember a phrase that appeared on the page, or an idea discussed on the page, locating the page is much harder.
# Type the most uniquely identifying keywords for the page you are looking for. The goal is to quickly find the page you are looking for. To do this, you want to type words that (1) identify the page of interest; and (2) identify as few as possible of pages that are not of interest. If you visit many pages on en.wikipedia.org, then typing "wikipedia" will certainly identify the page of interest, but it will also find many other pages that are not of interest. The end result is that you will only find the most recent or most frequently visited pages on Wikipedia, rather than the specific article you are looking for. It is better to type some word from the article title.
# If you can't find what you're looking for, try variations on words. It is possible that (1) you misremembered a specific word that appears in the URL or title (e.g. you remembered a synonym instead of the actual word); (2) the page uses a variant spelling (e.g. US vs UK spelling); (3) the word-breaking used in the URL or title is different (e.g. "commandline" vs "command-line" vs "command line", "CamelCase" vs "camel case").
# If you can't locate the URL in your history, try using a search engine. The address bar in both Chrome and Firefox will allow you to directly search the web (using the default search engine or search engine specified in the settings). If the history-based suggestions are not helpful, try hitting Enter anyway to see if a search engine can help.

===Using the history search===

To make the results appear quickly, the omnibox in Chrome limits the set of URLs it will search through. (Firefox may or may not limit the URLs it will search through in the Awesome Bar.) If the URL you want to navigate to does not appear in the omnibox, another option is to use the browser history.

# In Chrome, you can go to the browser history by typing Ctrl+H, or clicking Menu (⋮ or ☰) → History → History, or typing <code>chrome://history/</code> in the omnibox and hitting Enter.
# At the top is a search box that says "Search history".
# You can now type keywords or parts of a URL to filter the list of results.

Note: both Chrome and Firefox seem to delete old history, so if you last visited a page a long time ago, it may not appear in the history search.<ref>[https://www.quora.com/Does-Mozilla-Firefox-delete-old-history-entries-from-its-places-sqlite-file "Does Mozilla Firefox delete old history entries from its places.sqlite file?"] Quora. Retrieved September 5, 2018.</ref>

===Understanding site-specific URL manipulation===

If you frequently use a particular website, it may be worth understanding the URL structure of the website so you can navigate it more easily.

If you haven't visited the specific URL you want, but you've visited similar URLs, then you can call up the similar URL and edit it by hand.

# Example from GitHub: Suppose you have visited the URL <code>https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/blob/master/doc/lua-filters.md</code> before. Then you can type in the address bar <code>lua filters</code> to call up this stored URL. If you then want to see the version history of this file, you can change the <code>blob</code> to <code>commits</code>. If you want to see other files in the same directory, you can delete the filename <code>lua-filters.md</code> and change the <code>blob</code> to <code>tree</code>. In both of these cases, you ''can'' first visit <code>https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/blob/master/doc/lua-filters.md</code> and then click on a link on that page to navigate to the other pages. However, manipulating the URL will allow you to get to your destination without first loading the original page.
# Example from Wikipedia: Suppose you want to see the revision history of a particular Wikipedia page, <code>X</code>. Suppose also that you have visited at least one revision history page for a different Wikipedia article, <code>Y</code>. Then you can type <code>wikipedia history</code> in your address bar to call up <code>https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Y&action=history</code>, then change the <code>Y</code> to <code>X</code> to get <code>https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=X&action=history</code>.

===Understanding site-specific search===

If you cannot remember a word that appears in the title or URL of the page you are looking for, then the address bar/history search approaches don't work. In this case, if you happen to remember a word that appears in the body of the page ''and'' you remember the website it was on, then using a site-specific search can be a good idea.

# Figure out if the website has a search box. Note that some websites have search boxes that function poorly. An example of a website with a fairly good search box is the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&profile=advanced&search=&fulltext=1 English Wikipedia].
# If the website has a good search box, try typing in some words and hitting Enter. Some search boxes support advanced features like Boolean operators, so you may want to check for these.
# If the website doesn't have a search box or only has a bad search box, you can try using a generic search engine with the <code>site:</code> operator. For example, typing [https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aen.wikipedia.org+the+pillows <code>site:en.wikipedia.org the pillows</code>] on Google will search for the string <code>the pillows</code> on the domain en.wikipedia.org (i.e. the English Wikipedia).

===Using the history database===

On your computer, both Chrome and Firefox keep a SQLite database of your browser history. This means that if you are already familiar with databases, you can work with your browser history in the same way. For example, you can list all of your history, filter through some subset of your history according to arbitrary criteria (e.g. substring match, fuzzy search, regular expressions), and programmatically process your history.

Working directly with the history database takes some preparation, in terms of locating the database, learning the structure of the tables, and looking for or writing custom tools. Therefore, most users will probably not want to do this.

An example of using the Chrome history database is Junegunn Choi's article "Browsing Chrome history with fzf".<ref>Junegunn Choi. [https://junegunn.kr/2015/04/browsing-chrome-history-with-fzf/ "Browsing Chrome history with fzf"]. April 6, 2015. Retrieved August 30, 2018.</ref> This article describes the steps for writing a shell function that queries the history database and searches the whole history using a fuzzy finder called fzf. The upshot is that one can type a command ("c" in the article) at the terminal to search through one's entire Chrome history using fuzzy search and open the found URL using Chrome.

===Using a full mirror of the content===

If you need to repeatedly search the same site, you may want to consider making a full local mirror of the website content (or some subset of it). This is especially the case if the site has a bad search box and cannot be searched by a search engine. The article [[How to Archive Websites on Unix Like Systems]] covers some considerations for how to mirror a website.

Some example situations where you might want to do this:

# You frequently work with a specific repository on GitHub. Since GitHub repositories can easily be cloned, you can do this once and search through the repository using standard tools like your text editor/IDE and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep grep].
# You want to search through a personal archive, like your Gmail or Facebook Messenger messages, where the content is not public. These services often have a feature to export your personal content. Once downloaded, you can search through the results locally.
# You want to search through the contributions of a particular user on a website, but the website's search function doesn't allow you to filter by author. In this case, you can download all of the contributions of the user, then search locally.

===Understanding how the omnibox works===

''This section is only relevant to Google Chrome. This section also talks about Chromium rather than Chrome, because the latter is based on the former and only the source code for the former is publicly available.''

For the purposes of quickly navigating to a particular URL, probably the most important takeaways from the way the omnibox works are: (1) a URL is suggested only if there is a match at a word boundary for at least one word you typed; and (2) the omnibox doesn't search all of your history, so if you can't find something that you know you've visited before, going to history search is a good idea. The rest of this section looks at the omnibox in more detail.

# Understand the basic terminology used when talking about the omnibox.
#* A ''provider'' gives suggestions to the omnibox. There are various providers, each giving a specific list of suggestions given some input (or no input). In the Chromium source code, each provider is an [https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/omnibox/browser/autocomplete_provider.h?l=129&rcl=aa6aaad888ee4619f709de684992cac9b5d69075 <code>AutocompleteProvider</code>].
#* Two providers give history suggestions. These are [https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/omnibox/browser/history_url_provider.h?l=190&rcl=aa6aaad888ee4619f709de684992cac9b5d69075 <code>HistoryURLProvider</code>] and [https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/omnibox/browser/history_quick_provider.h?l=25&rcl=aa6aaad888ee4619f709de684992cac9b5d69075 <code>HistoryQuickProvider</code>]. The former specializes in giving suggestions based on prefix matches for a URL. The latter can give suggestions based on non-prefix matches, and also matches words in the title.
# For each provider, understand the conditions required for a URL to appear as a suggestion.<ref name="historyurl-vs-historyquick" />
#* For both <code>HistoryURLProvider</code> and <code>HistoryQuickProvider</code>, URLs are suggested only if visited in the last 3 days or visited at least 4 times or typed at least once.<ref name="historyurl-vs-historyquick">[https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/chromium-dev/hnKoQETXzyY/XiWJpZwLEQAJ "Understanding differences between HistoryURL and HistoryQuick providers, and exact conditions for when a URL is suggested by each"]. Chromium-dev mailing list. August 24, 2018.</ref>
#* The constants that modify the behavior of the history providers are all hard-coded in the source code (they don't seem to be modifiable in the preferences). This means that if you don't like their behavior, you can just change the values of these constants and recompile (but I think only on Chromium).
# Play around with the Omnibox Debug Page to build intuition
#* Visit <code>chrome://omnibox/</code> in Google Chrome.
#* Type text and hit Enter or click "Submit".
#* Search results will appear for what ''would'' be suggested in the omnibox.
#* Checking the different boxes like "Show all details" and "Show results per provider, not just merged results" will toggle the results to show more details.

===Understanding how the Awesome Bar works===

''This section is only relevant to Mozilla Firefox.''

frecency algorithm

I think frecency only covers the ''ranking'' of the results. How does firefox decide which URLs to match given some typed phrases?

notes:

this is a bit old, but might be useful https://stackoverflow.com/questions/540725/how-does-firefoxs-awesome-bar-match-strings

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Places/Frecency_algorithm

oh yeah, so firefox has these special characters like # and @ that you can use to search only some kinds of results http://kb.mozillazine.org/Location_Bar_search

"100 points for links in the most recent 4 days, 70 points for links in the next 10 days, 50 points for the next 31 days, 30 points for the next 90 days, and 10 points for all the rest of the links older than that." https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-complex-algorithms-used-in-making-Firefox/answer/Tanooj-Luthra

so maybe firefox uses the whole history, but just prioritizes the more recent ones

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Places/Frecency_algorithm$history

doesn't seem like there are many changes since 2011 or 2008

this file also maybe https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/places/History.cpp

ok, i think this is the most likely i've found so far https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/places/SQLFunctions.cpp#640

"Frecency Calculation Function"

and it actually goes into bonuses and stuff

https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?q=%2Bfunction%3AnsNavHistory%3A%3AUpdateFrecency%28int64_t%29

takes me to https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/places/nsNavHistory.cpp#3635

https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/search?q=CALCULATE_FRECENCY&path=

idk where CALCULATE_FRECENCY is defined

it seems to be a function defined in SQL

https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/places/tests/head_common.js#523

let stmt = DBConn().createStatement(
    "SELECT frecency FROM moz_places WHERE url_hash = hash(?1) AND url = ?1"
  );

so it looks like the frecency is stored in the db

ok, i just confirmed that it is

so ok, something like visiting a page triggers firefox to update and store the new frecency

and then when you type things in the url bar, it must be querying the db or something to get matching urls and ordering them by frecency

so something i still don't understand is how it ranks frecency vs how well the string matches. because it wouldn't make sense to rank poor string matches, even if i visit that site more
