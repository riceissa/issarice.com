This guide explores ways to navigate to URLs more efficiently, with a focus on the Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers. It does not cover bookmarks or custom keyword searches, as these are often covered in other guides.

==Steps==

===Basic search using the address bar (omnibox or Awesome Bar)===

The address bar (or URL/keyword navigation bar) at the top of the browser displays the current webpage's URL. Most of the time when navigating to a specific page that you have visited in the past, you will be typing words from the URL or title of the page into this bar and selecting from the suggestions given by the browser. In Google Chrome, this bar is called the "omnibox". In Mozilla Firefox, it is called the Awesome Bar.

# Figure out what you remember about a page. If you can remember words from the URL or title of the page, that makes searching much easier (because the URL and title are what the browser remembers about the page). If you can only remember a phrase that appeared on the page, or an idea discussed on the page, locating the page is much harder.
# Type the most uniquely identifying keywords for the page you are looking for. The goal is to quickly find the page you are looking for. To do this, you want to type words that (1) identify the page of interest; and (2) identify as few as possible of pages that are not of interest. If you visit many pages on en.wikipedia.org, then typing "wikipedia" will certainly identify the page of interest, but it will also find many other pages that are not of interest. The end result is that you will only find the most recent or most frequently visited pages on Wikipedia, rather than the specific article you are looking for. It is better to type some word from the article title.
# If you can't find what you're looking for, try variations on words. It is possible that (1) you misremembered a specific word that appears in the URL or title (e.g. you remembered a synonym); (2) the page uses a variant spelling (e.g. US vs UK spelling); (3) the word-breaking used in the URL or title is different (e.g. "sunset" vs "sun set", "CamelCase" vs "camel case").
# If you can't locate the URL in your history, try using a search engine. The address bar in both Chrome and Firefox will allow you to directly search the web (using the default search engine). If the history-based suggestions are not helpful, try hitting enter anyway to see if a search engine can help.

===Understanding site-specific URL manipulation===

If you frequently use a particular website, it may be worth understanding the URL structure of the website so you can navigate it more easily.

If you haven't visited the specific URL you want, but you've visited similar URLs, then you can call up the similar URL and edit it by hand.

Example: GitHub: blob vs tree vs blame vs commits vs compare

Example: if you're browsing a reddit comment, you can delete the last part of the URL to return to the thread.

===Understanding site-specific search===

Some sites have good search; if this is the case, it can often be better than searching through your browser history.

e.g. Wikipedia has revision search.

Even for sites that don't have good search, you can often get away with using the <code>site:</code> operator on Google.

For sites where you can mirror the content locally, downloading some subset and searching locally using standard tools (grep, etc.) might be better. Example: for a GitHub repo, you might have cloned the repo already, and navigating the source tree using your text editor might be easier; Gmail and Facebook Messenger have exporting features, even if their own search might miss some results.

navigating by clicking is also possible, but often much slower: https://www.benkuhn.net/autocomplete

===Using the history search===

To make the results appear quickly, the omnibox limits the set of URLs it will search through. If the URL you want to navigate to does not appear in the omnibox, another option is to use the browser history.

# In Chrome, you can go to the browser history by typing Ctrl+H, or clicking Menu (⋮ or ☰) → History → History, or typing <code>chrome://history/</code> in the omnibox and hitting Enter.
# At the top is a search box that says "Search history".
# You can now type keywords or parts of a URL to filter the list of results.

I think Chrome deletes old history, so even this doesn't guarantee that you will find a URL that you've visited.

===Using the history database===

On your computer, both Chrome and Firefox keep a SQLite database of your browser history. This means that if you are already familiar with databases, you can work with your browser history in the same way. For example, you can list all of your history, filter through some subset of your history according to arbitrary criteria (e.g. substring match, fuzzy search, regular expressions), and programmatically process your history.

Working directly with the history database takes some preparation, in terms of locating the database, learning the structure of the tables, and looking for or writing custom tools. Therefore, most users will probably not want to do this.

An example of using the Chrome history database is Junegunn Choi's article "Browsing Chrome history with fzf".<ref>Junegunn Choi. [https://junegunn.kr/2015/04/browsing-chrome-history-with-fzf/ "Browsing Chrome history with fzf"]. April 6, 2015. Retrieved August 30, 2018.</ref> This article describes the steps for writing a shell function that queries the history database and searches the whole history using a fuzzy finder called fzf. The upshot is that one can type a command ("c" in the article) at the terminal to search through one's entire Chrome history using fuzzy search and open the found URL using Chrome.

===Understanding how the omnibox works===

# Understand the basic terminology used when talking about the omnibox.
#* omnibox vs ??
#* what a "provider" is. In the Chromium source code, each provider is an [https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/omnibox/browser/autocomplete_provider.h?l=129&rcl=aa6aaad888ee4619f709de684992cac9b5d69075 <code>AutocompleteProvider</code>].
#* The two history providers are [https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/omnibox/browser/history_url_provider.h?l=190&rcl=aa6aaad888ee4619f709de684992cac9b5d69075 <code>HistoryURLProvider</code>] and [https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/omnibox/browser/history_quick_provider.h?l=25&rcl=aa6aaad888ee4619f709de684992cac9b5d69075 <code>HistoryQuickProvider</code>]; these two apparently differ somehow, but it's not clear what the difference is (HistoryQuick seems to be newer). Other providers include BookmarkProvider and KeywordProvider.
# For each provider, understand the conditions required for a URL to appear as a suggestion.
#* e.g. for HistoryQuick, conditions on last visit, typed count, visit count
#* for HistoryURL, ???
#* for Search, ???
#* The constants that modify the behavior of the history providers are all hard-coded in the source code (they don't seem to be modifiable in the preferences). This means that if you don't like their behavior, you can just change the values of these constants and recompile (but I think only on Chromium).
# Play around with the Omnibox Debug Page to build intuition
#* Visit <code>chrome://omnibox/</code> in Google Chrome.
#* Type text and hit Enter or click "Submit".
#* Search results will appear for what ''would'' be suggested in the omnibox.
#* Checking the different boxes like "Show all details" and "Show results per provider, not just merged results" will toggle the results to show more details.
