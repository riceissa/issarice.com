The effort lasted from 1982 to the 1990s, and generally coincides with [[James P. Grant]]'s tenure as executive director of UNICEF (1980–1995). The child survival revolution included various programs and conferences, including the [[World Summit for Children]] in 1990.<ref name=gautam/>

Rather than treating child mortality as a measurement of development, the effort sought to directly reduce child mortality as a way toward development.<ref name="unicef">{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc96/1980s.htm |title=The 1980s: Campaign for child survival |publisher=UNICEF}}</ref>

Although the revolution was started by UNICEF, other organizations, including the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], [[UNDP]], the [[World Bank]], and [[WHO]] joined; thus the revolution is sometimes called "a grand alliance for children".<ref name=unicef/> The revolution was analogized with the [[Green Revolution]] by James Grant.<ref name=jim_grant_book/>{{rp|42}}

==Results and reception==

The initial reaction to Grant's announcement of the child survival revolution was overwhelmingly negative due to several reasons, including practical reasons (e.g. the money and infrastructure to support Grant's plans not existing).<ref name=jim_grant_book/>{{rp|24}}

It is estimated that the child vaccination increased worldwide from 20% in 1982(?) to 80% in 1990 because of the child survival revolution.<ref>Maggie Black, Children First: The Story of UNICEF, Past and Present (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), 33; see also UNICEF, The State of the World’s Children 1986 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985), 5.</ref>

Writing in 1990, [[D. A. Henderson]] noted that although "dramatic progress" had been made because of the child survival revolution, the results were still "little-appreciated".<ref name=henderson/>

The child survival revolution is estimated to have saved the lives of 25 million children.<ref name=jim_grant_book/>{{rp|59}}

==Focus areas==

For much of the child survival revolution, James Grant and UNICEF adopted a strategy was known as [[GOBI-FFF]], a form of selective primary healthcare:<ref>David Bornstein (2007). How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas New York: Oxford University Press pp. 250</ref>

{{quote |text=G for growth monitoring to detect undernutrition in small children, O for [[oral rehydration therapy]] [ORT] to treat childhood diarrhea, B to encourage breastfeeding (which had declined precipitously due to working mothers and the marketing of infant formula), and I for immunization against the six basic childhood diseases: tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, and measles. (They added two Fs: food supplements and family planning; and, later, a third: female education.)}}

Of these, "immunization and ORT were seen as the 'twin-engines' of the child survival revolution".<ref name=gautam/><ref name="jim_grant_book">{{cite book |title=Jim Grant: UNICEF Visionary |author=Peter Adamson, Carol Bellamy, Kul Gautam, Richard Jolly, Nyi Nyi, Mary Racelis, Richard Reid, Jon Rohde |year=2001 |url=http://www.unicef.org/publications/index_4402.html |publisher=UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre}}</ref>{{rp|23}}

After 1986, when studies by [[Alfred Sommer]] and others were published, [[vitamin A]] administration also became a focus.<ref name=henderson/>

==Organizations involved==

Although the revolution was started by UNICEF, other organizations were involved.

* [[Rockefeller Foundation]]<ref name=unicef/>
* [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP)
* [[World Bank]]
* [[World Health Organization]] (WHO)
* [[Rotary International]] pledged to raise $120 million.<ref name="henderson">{{cite article |title=The Child Survival Revolution |author=[[D. A. Henderson]] |year=1990 |journal=Pediatric Research}}</ref>

==Use of mass media==

UNICEF took advantage of the growing levels of basic education and access to television and radio to generate support for the child survival revolution through persuasion.<ref name=unicef/>

James Grant also "persuaded many heads of state to get personally involved in their national programmes for children, for example in their immunization by being photographed giving polio drops to a baby". Several figures from film and sports, like [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Liv Ullman]], and [[Peter Ustinov]] also participated in the [[List of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors|UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador program]].<ref name=jim_grant_book/>{{rp|62}}
