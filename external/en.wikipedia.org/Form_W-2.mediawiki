'''Form W-2''' (officially, the "Wage and Tax Statement") is used to report wages paid to employees and the [[Tax withholding in the United States|taxes withheld]] from them.<ref>See generally {{usc|26|6051}}, 26 C.F.R. sec. 31.6051-1 and sec. 31.6051-2.</ref> Employers must complete a Form W-2 for each employee to whom they pay a salary, wage, or other compensation as part of the employment relationship. An employer must mail out the Form W-2 to employees on or before January 31. This deadline gives these taxpayers about 2 months to prepare their returns before the April 15 income tax due date. The form is also used to report [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA taxes]] to the [[Social Security Administration]]. The Form W-2, along with Form W-3, generally must be filed by the employer with the Social Security Administration by the end of February. Relevant amounts on Form W-2 are reported by the Social Security Administration to the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. In  territories, the W-2 is issued with a two letter code indicating which territory, such as W-2GU for Guam. If corrections are made, it can be done on a W-2c.
