[[File:Form_W-2,_2016.pdf|thumb|right|Form W-2, 2016|page=2]]

'''Form W-2''' (officially, the "Wage and Tax Statement") is an [[IRS tax forms|Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax form]] used in the United States to report wages paid to employees and the [[Tax withholding in the United States|taxes withheld]] from them.<ref>See generally {{usc|26|6051}}, 26 C.F.R. sec. 31.6051-1 and sec. 31.6051-2.</ref> Employers must complete a Form W-2 for each employee to whom they pay a salary, wage, or other compensation as part of the employment relationship. An employer must mail out the Form W-2 to employees on or before January 31. This deadline gives these taxpayers about 2 months to prepare their returns before the April 15 income tax due date. The form is also used to report [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA taxes]] to the [[Social Security Administration]]. The Form W-2, along with Form W-3, generally must be filed by the employer with the Social Security Administration by the end of February. Relevant amounts on Form W-2 are reported by the Social Security Administration to the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. In  territories, the W-2 is issued with a two letter code indicating which territory, such as W-2GU for Guam. If corrections are made, it can be done on a W-2c.

==Significance for employee's tax return==

Form W-2 includes wage and salary information as well as federal, state, and other taxes that were withheld. This information is used by the employee when they complete their individual tax return using [[Form 1040]].<ref name="turbo_w2">{{cite web |url=https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/IRS-Tax-Forms/What-is-a-W-2-Form-/INF14812.html |title=What is a W-2 Form? |accessdate=January 25, 2016 |date=2015}}</ref>

An employer must mail out the Form W-2 to employees on or before January 31. This deadline gives these taxpayers about 2 months to prepare their returns before the [[Tax Day|April 15 income tax due date]].<ref name="turbo_w2" />

When an employee prepares their individual tax return for a tax year, the withholding amount from Form W-2 is subtracted from the tax due. It is possible to receive a refund from the IRS if more income was withheld than necessary.<ref name="turbo_w2" />

Since the IRS receives a copy of the W-2 from the employer, if the amount reported on the W-2 does not match the amount reported on Form 1040, the IRS may get suspicious. In addition, if an individual does not pay the required amount of taxes, the IRS will also know this.<ref name="turbo_w2" /> In this way, the IRS uses Form W-2 as a way to track an employee's tax liability, and the form has come to be seen as a formal proof of income. The [[Social Security Administration]], court proceedings, and applications for federal financial aid for college may all use Form W-2 as proof of income.<ref name="ambar" />

The employee receives three copies of Form W-2: one for the record, one for the federal tax return, and one for the state tax return.<ref name="ambar" /> Form W-2 must be attached to one's individual tax return; this is to substantiate claims of withholding.<ref name="turbo_w2" />

Employees are required to report their wage, salary, and tip income even if they don't receive a Form W-2 for it.

===Tip income===

Employees are required to report their tip income to their employers (usually using Form 4070). Tips are subject to income withholding. There are various other requirements when handling tips for tax purposes.<ref name="irs_tips">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-%26-Self-Employed/Reporting-Tip-Income-Restaurant-Tax-Tips |title=Reporting Tip Income - Restaurant Tax Tips |accessdate=January 28, 2016}}</ref>

==Filing requirements==

Form W-2 must be completed by the employers and be in the mail to be sent to employees by January 31. The deadline to the IRS is February 29. For electronic filings, the deadline to the IRS is April 2.<ref name="chron">{{cite web |url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/penalties-employers-late-w2s-22027.html |title=What Are the Penalties to Employers for Late W-2s? |accessdate=January 25, 2016 |last=Myers |first=Cynthia}}</ref>

===Who must file?===

Form W-2 is completed by employers who pay a wage or salary to employees.<ref name=investopedia_w2" /> However, Form W-2 is not used for contract workers. For independent contractors, [[Form 1099-MISC]] is used to report earnings.<ref name="turbo_w2" />

===Filing modalities===

Traditionally Form W-2 has been completed by paper. [[Tax compliance software]] such as [[TurboTax]] allow the form to be completed electronically.<ref name="investopedia_w2">{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/w2form.asp |title=W-2 Form |accessdate=January 25, 2016}}</ref> For paper filing, Form W-2 can be ordered from the IRS website.

When filing by paper, Copy A of the form cannot be printed from the IRS website. In other words, the official form ordered from the IRS must be used.<ref name="actual_form_w2">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw2.pdf |title=Form W-2 |accessdate=January 28, 2016 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}</ref>

==Penalties==

Late filings within 30 days of the due date incur a penalty of $30 per form. After 30 days but before August 1, the penalty increases to $60 per form (capped between $200–$500 depending on size of business). After August 1, the penalty increases to $100 per form (capped between $500–$1500 depending on size of business).<ref name="chron" />

The penalty for a single incorrect Form W-2 is $250 per receiving party (capped anually at $3 million); this means a single incorrect Form W-2 to both the employer and the IRS incurs a penalty of $500. The penalty of intentionally failing to file is $500.<ref name="lexology">{{cite web |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=dab5213a-aca5-4271-98b5-853a4af84e4a |title= Penalties for incorrect W-2, 1099s just doubled |accessdate=January 25, 2016 |date=July 22, 2015 |authors=Sharon B. Bauman, Alan M. Brunswick, Esra Acikalin Hudson, Sandra R. King, Stanley W. Levy and Mandana Massoumi}}</ref>

Further penalties exist for illegible forms and for filing by paper even past the 250 form limit.<ref name="chron" />

==History==

Use of Form W-2 was established by the [[Current Tax Payment Act of 1943]] as part of an effort to withhold income at source. The first Form W-2s were issued to employees in 1944.<ref name="ambar">{{cite web |url=https://www.americanbar.org/publications/insights_on_law_andsociety/15/winter-2015/getting-to-know-irs-w2-form.html |title=Getting to Know the IRS W-2 Form |accessdate=January 25, 2016 |publisher=American Bar Association}}</ref>

In 1965, the form's name was changed from "Withholding Tax Statement" to "Wage and Tax Statement" (current name).<ref name="ambar" />

In 1978, the form's appearance changed to its modern style of numbered boxes.<ref name="ambar" />

As with the US tax code and other forms (such as the [[Form 1040#History|1040]]), Form W-2 has become more complicated over time.<ref name="ambar" />

The penalty for incorrect forms was increased in 2015.<ref name="lexology" />
