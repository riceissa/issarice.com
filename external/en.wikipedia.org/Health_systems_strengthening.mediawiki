'''Health systems strengthening''' (also '''health system strengthening''', abbreviated '''HSS''') is a term used in [[global health]] that roughly means to improve the health care system of a country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthsystems/hss_glossary/en/index5.html |accessdate=June 14, 2016 |title=Health Systems Strengthening Glossary |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}</ref> Within this general definition, it can mean increasing funding for health infrastructure, improving health policy, trying to achieve [[universal healthcare]],<ref name="glassman">{{cite web |url=http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Amanda%20Glassman%208-27-13.pdf |title=Conversation with Amanda Glassman on August 27, 2013 |accessdate=June 14, 2016 |last=Glassman |first=Amanda |publisher=[[GiveWell]]}}</ref> or any number of other health measures.

There has been some effort to use a [[systems thinking]] approach to health systems strengthening.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hfgproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/New-Perspectives-in-Health-Systems-Strengthening-Executive-Summary.pdf |publisher=USAID |title=New Perspectives in Health Systems Strengthening}}</ref><ref name="systems-thinking-book">{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44204/1/9789241563895_eng.pdf |title=Systems Thinking for Health Systems Strengthening |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2009}}</ref>

==Organizations that use health systems strengthening==

Various health organizations have claimed to use health systems strengthening (while not necessarily agreeing on the definition). Some of these are:

* [[World Health Organization]]
* [[US Agency for International Development]] (USAID, uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report);<ref name=marchal/> USAID states that HSS has been "at the core of [its] mission in health for the last 20 years", and defines HSS as "initiating activities in the six internationally accepted core HSS functions – human resources for health; health finance; health governance; health information; medical products, vaccines, and technologies; and service delivery".<ref name=usaid>{{cite web |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1864/HSS-Vision.pdf |title=USAID's Vision for Health Systems Strengthening |publisher=USAID |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}</ref>
* [[GAVI Alliance]]<ref name=marchal/>
* The [[Global Fund]]<ref name=marchal/>
* [[PEPFAR]] (though less developed)<ref name=marchal/>
* [[Stop TB Partnership]] (uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report)<ref name=marchal/>
* [[Roll Back Malaria]] (uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report)<ref name=marchal/>

==Reception==

Both the idea of health systems strengthening and the term itself have received attention.

Even advocates of health systems strengthening admit that it can often seem like a "distant, even abstract aim".<ref name=systems-thinking-book/>

Marchal et al., writing in 2009, call the term "vague" and "argue that most current HSS strategies are selective (i.e., they target a specific disease), and their effects may undermine progress towards the long-term goal of effective, high-quality, and inclusive health systems."<ref name="marchal">{{cite web |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000059#s2 |title=Global Health Actors Claim To Support Health System Strengthening—Is This Reality or Rhetoric? |authors=Marchal B, Cavalli A, Kegels G |date=April 28, 2009 |publisher=''[[PLOS Medicine]]''}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://karengrepin.com/2009/04/are-health-system-strengthening-efforts.html |title=Are health system strengthening efforts just hype? |date=April 29, 2009 |author=Karen Grepin |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}</ref>

[[Peter Berman]], who was the lead health economist at the [[World Bank]], has pointed out that "Almost any support to health interventions can be considered HSS".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTHSD/Resources/376278-1114111154043/1011834-1246449110524/062509BermanUnpackingHealthSystemStrengthening.pdf |author=Peter Berman |date=June 2009 |publisher=World Bank |title=Unpacking Health System Strengthening |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}</ref>
