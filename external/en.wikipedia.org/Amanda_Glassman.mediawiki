==Views==

Glassman has defended the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]]'s focus on vaccines, stating "For me, vaccination is the quintessential public health intervention. If we can't get that right, we probably shouldn't be doing other things."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alliancemagazine.org/feature/interview-amanda-glassman/ |title=Interview – Amanda Glassman |publisher=''[[Alliance Magazine]]'' |date=September 1, 2011 |author=Caroline Hartnell |accessdate=June 7, 2016}}</ref>

Glassman has criticized the [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] for lack of transparency, writing that "very little quality information exists on how and where Global Fund money is spent, and what it is accomplishing" and that the "Global Fund must put as much energy into getting results as delivering rhetoric, pursuing performance verification with no less vigour than advocacy".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/sep/27/global-fund-results-aids-malaria-tuberculosis |author=Amanda Glassman |date=September 27, 2016 |title=Global Fund's $15bn must buy results rather than rhetoric |publisher=''The Guardian'' |accessdate=June 7, 2016}}</ref>
