This page is a '''comparison of methods of malaria control''', covering methods of both prevention and treatment.

==TODO==

* get more vaccines from [[Malaria vaccine]]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_residual_spraying#Approved_insecticides
* other columns? cost, cost-effectiveness, countries in which it is banned/approved, recommendation by orgs, global distribution (how many tons manufactured/used per annum? what percentage of malaria is treated using this drug? etc.)

==Methods==

Use of insecticides has two main variables: method of delivery and the insecticide itself. This table covers the former; the latter are numerous and are covered separately in a second table below.

Type := Prevention {{!}} Treatment {{!}} Both

ACT (artemisinin combinatorial therapy) -- different from artenisinin?

also "comprehensive surveillance" gets mentioned a lot, in the course of using the other things.

==Insecticides==

All insecticides act against mosquitoes and are used for prevention. (?)
