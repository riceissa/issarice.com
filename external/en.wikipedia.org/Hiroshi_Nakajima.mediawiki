==Professional life==

===Before 1974: France and Japan===

From 1956 or 1958 to 1967 Nakajima worked at the [[French National Institute of Health and Medical Research]]<ref name="nyt1988">{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/15/world/japanese-scientist-will-head-world-health-organization.html |date=January 15, 1988 |title=Japanese Scientist Will Head World Health Organization |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |accessdate=October 18, 2016}}</ref> doing medical and pharmaceutical research.<ref name="lewis_nyt" /> After his stay in France, he returned to Japan and became research director of Nippon Roche, a Japanese subsidiary of [[Hoffmann-La Roche]].<ref name="lewis_nyt" /><ref name="pincock" />

===Early work at WHO===

Nakajima joined [[WHO]] in 1974<ref name="lewis_nyt" /> in the position of Scientist, Drug Evaluation and Monitoring. In 1976, he became Chief of the WHO Drug Policies and Management Unit. It was in this position that he played a key role in developing the concept of [[essential drugs]], as Secretary of the first Expert Committee on the subject.

In 1978<ref name="pincock" /> or 1979,<ref name="lewis_nyt" /> the WHO Regional Committee for the Western Pacific nominated and elected Nakajima as Regional Director, an office he held for two consecutive terms until 1988 when he was elected Director-General of WHO.

===1988–1993: First term as Director-General of WHO===

In January 1988 the WHO executive board selected Nakajima to become Director-General in a 17-to-14 vote over Carlyle Guerra de Macedo of Brazil.<ref name="lewis_nyt">{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/01/world/divided-world-health-organization-braces-for-leadership-change.html?pagewanted=all |date=May 1, 1988 |title=Divided World Health Organization Braces for Leadership Change |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |accessdate=October 19, 2016 |first1=Paul |last1=Lewis}}</ref>

During his leadership at WHO he notoriously had a conflict with then head of the WHO's Global Programme on AIDS (GPA), [[Jonathan Mann (WHO official)|Jonathan Mann]], which resulted in Mann's resignation.<ref>http://videocheck.entropymedia.com/aidssearch?s=mann</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/04/us/jonathan-mann-aids-pioneer-is-dead-at-51.html |author=Philip J.

During his tenure, Nakajima was also accused of being a poor communicator and administrator.<ref name="james_nyt">{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/22/news/22iht-who__0.html |date=January 22, 1993 |title=West Decries Re-election of WHO Chief |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |accessdate=October 18, 2016 |first1=Barry |last1=James}}</ref>

During his first term in 1988, the [[Global Polio Eradication Initiative]] was launched.<ref name="pincock" />

===1993–1998: Second term as Director-General of WHO===

In May 1993, Nakajima was re-elected in a 93-to-58 vote to a second term of office as Director-General. His re-election was opposed by all major donor countries to the WHO including the United States. There was controversy surrounding this re-election because the WHO awarded contracts to executive board members prior to the vote by the executive board in January.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/06/world/embattled-japanese-doctor-retains-who-post.html |date=May 6, 1993 |title=Embattled Japanese Doctor Retains W.H.O.

In 1997, Nakajima announced that he was not seeking another re-election and that his term of office would end in July 1998. He was replaced by [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] of Norway, whose candidacy was supported by the United States and the European Union.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/136702.stm |title=New broom at WHO |date=July 21, 1998 |accessdate=October 19, 2016 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref>
