==Evaluation of the initiative==

An evaluation team commissioned by the [[Canadian International Development Agency] (CIDA) and WHO reviewed the 3 by 5 initiative between July 2005 and March 2006. The evaluation team published their report in March 2006, titled ''Progress on global access to HIV antiretroviral therapy: a report on "3 by 5" and beyond''. It was found that 1.3 million people were receiving antiretroviral treatment in the target countries by December 2005, up from 400,000 before the start of the initiative.<ref name=eval/>
