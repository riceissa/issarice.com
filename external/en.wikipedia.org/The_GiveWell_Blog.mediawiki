'''The GiveWell Blog''' is the official blog of the [[charity evaluator]] [[GiveWell]].

==History==

[[Holden Karnofsky]] said he would post every Tuesday and Saturday.,. where is he?/.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2006/12/23/nice-to-meet-you/ |title=Nice to meet you |website=The GiveWell Blog |publisher=[[GiveWell]] |first=Holden |last=Karnofsky|date=September 9, 2015 |accessdate=February 11, 2017 |quote=I’m Holden, and I’m the guy who will be making sure this blog gets updated twice a week (Tuesday and Saturday) at a minimum. So if you’ve been wishing there were more blogs to read, you’ll be getting to know me well.}}</ref>

in the early days, the blog was more freeflowing just like the org itself, with posts like "An open letter to crybabies", "Donating to Gates – against its will", and "Chocolate-covered broccoli". Early posts also used more images.

guest posts: mention that [[David Roodman]] did one.

in 201X the blog split off so that some content is now posted on the [[Open Philanthropy Project]] blog.
