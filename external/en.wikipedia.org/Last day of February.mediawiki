On the [[Gregorian calendar]], the '''last day of February''' is [[February 28]] or [[February 29]], depending on the year. On [[leap year]]s it is the 29th and on all other years it is the 28th. Other calendars have or had a [[February 30]]. In some contexts, March 0 is also an imaginary date that refers to the last day of February.

The phrase "the last day of February" is sometimes used to indicate a deadline that varies by year, for instance in certain [[IRS tax forms]].
