'''Voices of the Poor''' was an effort in the 1990s through 2000 by the [[World Bank]] to collect the experiences of the poor across the world. The name is also used for the reports that were eventually published from the effort. The effort consisted of two parts: primary research using [[participatory poverty assessment]] (PPA)<ref name="mcgee">McGee, Rosemary, ed. ''Knowing Poverty''. London, GB: Routledge, 2012. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 11 May 2016.</ref>{{rp|4}} in 23 countries, and reviews of existing PPAs and other participatory research. The project was originally called "Consultations with the Poor", but was changed to "Voices of the Poor" in late 1999.<ref name=mcgee/>{{rp|12}}

Voices of the Poor also informed the 2000 [[World Development Report]].<ref name=mcgee/>{{rp|4}}

==Key findings==

The key findings of this study include the following:<ref name="ppa_guide"/>{{rp|87}}

* Poverty is multidimensional (i.e. the poor deal not just with lack of money, but with various problems like lack of resources, poor health, physical violence, social isolation, etc.).
* [[NGO]]s have a limited role in the lives of the poor.

==Reception==

Writing in 2003, Hiroki Nogami praised Voices of the Poor for its use of qualitative analyses, but noted that the study did not sufficiently take into account how the opinions of the poor change with time and location.<ref name=nogami/>{{rp|391}}

==See also==

* ''[[Moving Out of Poverty]]'', a later project by the World Bank that distinguishes itself from Voices of the Poor in that it focuses on the dynamics of moving out of (and falling back into) poverty, and it is a longitudinal study rather than a snapshot in time.

* [[Disease Control Priorities Project]]
