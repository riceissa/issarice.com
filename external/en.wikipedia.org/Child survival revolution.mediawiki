The '''child survival revolution''' (also called the '''child survival and development revolution'''<ref name="gautam">{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kul-chandra-gautam/child-mortality_b_1619727.html |title=USAID and UNICEF: A Winning Partnership for Child Survival and Development |author=Kul Chandra Gautam |date=August 22, 2012 |publisher=Huffington Post}}</ref><ref name="gates">{{cite web |url=http://www.impatientoptimists.org/Posts/2011/02/Jim-Grants-Child-Survival-Revolution |title= Jim Grant's 'Child Survival Revolution' |date= February 17, 2011 |author=Bill Gates}}</ref>) was an effort started by [[UNICEF]] (but joined by others) to reduce child mortality. The child survival revolution included various programs and conferences. Rather than treating child mortality as a measurement of development, the effort sought to directly reduce child mortality as a way toward development.<ref name="unicef">{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc96/1980s.htm |title=The 1980s: Campaign for child survival |publisher=UNICEF}}</ref>

started officially in 1982 

the child survival revolution was analogized with the [[Green Revolution]] by James Grant.<ref name=jim_grant_book/>{{rp|42}}

as part of the revolution, Grant persuaded the [[United Nations]] to convene the [[World Summit for Children]] in 1990.<ref name=gautam/>

UNICEF took advantage of the growing levels of basic education and access to television and radio to generate support for the child survival revolution through persuasion.<ref name=unicef/>

Although the revolution was started by UNICEF, other organizations, including the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], [[UNDP]], the [[World Bank]], and [[WHO]] joined; thus the revolution is sometimes called "a grand alliance for children".<ref name=unicef/>

In 1982, Grant and Unicef launched the child survival revolution and unveiled a simple but effective strategy for reducing child fatality. His strategy was known as [[GOBI-FFF]]:<ref>David Bornstein (2007). How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas New York: Oxford University Press pp. 250</ref> {{Quote|G for growth monitoring to detect undernutrition in small children, O for oral rehydration therapy to treat childhood diarrhea, B to encourage breastfeeding (which had declined precipitously due to working mothers and the marketing of infant formula), and I for immunization against the six basic childhood diseases: tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, and measles. (They added two Fs: food supplements and family planning; and, later, a third: female education.)}}

==Results and reception==

The initial reaction to Grant's announcement of the child survival revolution was overwhelmingly negative due to several reasons, including practical reasons (e.g. the money and infrastructure to support Grant's plans not existing).<ref name=jim_grant_book/>{{rp|24}}

It is estimated that the child vaccination increased worldwide from 20% in 1982(?) to 80% in 1990 because of the child survival revolution.<ref>Maggie Black, Children First: The Story of UNICEF, Past and Present (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), 33; see also UNICEF, The State of the World’s Children 1986 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985), 5.</ref>

Writing in 1990, [[D. A. Henderson]] noted that although "dramatic progress" had been made because of the child survival revolution, the results were still "little-appreciated".<ref name=henderson/>
