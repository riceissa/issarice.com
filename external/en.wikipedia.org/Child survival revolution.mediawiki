The child survival revolution included various programs and conferences. Rather than treating child mortality as a measurement of development, the effort sought to directly reduce child mortality as a way toward development.<ref name="unicef">{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc96/1980s.htm |title=The 1980s: Campaign for child survival |publisher=UNICEF}}</ref>

as part of the revolution, Grant persuaded the [[United Nations]] to convene the [[World Summit for Children]] in 1990.<ref name=gautam/>

UNICEF took advantage of the growing levels of basic education and access to television and radio to generate support for the child survival revolution through persuasion.<ref name=unicef/>

Although the revolution was started by UNICEF, other organizations, including the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], [[UNDP]], the [[World Bank]], and [[WHO]] joined; thus the revolution is sometimes called "a grand alliance for children".<ref name=unicef/>

In 1982, Grant and Unicef launched the child survival revolution and unveiled a simple but effective strategy for reducing child fatality. His strategy was known as [[GOBI-FFF]]: “G for growth monitoring to detect undernutrition in small children, O for oral rehydration therapy to treat childhood diarrhea, B to encourage breastfeeding (which had declined precipitously due to working mothers and the marketing of infant formula), and I for immunization against the six basic childhood diseases: tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, and measles. (They added two Fs: food supplements and family planning; and, later, a third: female education.)” <ref>David Bornstein (2007).

It is estimated that the child vaccination increased from 20 to 80 percent worldwide in 1990 because of Grant’s “child survival revolution.”  <ref>Maggie Black, Children First: The Story of UNICEF, Past and Present (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), 33; see also UNICEF, The State of the World’s Children 1986 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985), 5.</ref>

==Reception==

The initial reaction to Grant's announcement of the child survival revolution was overwhelmingly negative due to several reasons, including practical reasons (e.g. the money and infrastructure to support Grant's plans not existing).<ref name=jim_grant_book/>{{rp|24}}
