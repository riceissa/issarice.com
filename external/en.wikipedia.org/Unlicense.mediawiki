The '''Unlicense''' is a [[public domain equivalent license]] with a focus on an [[anti-copyright]] message. It was first published on January 1 ([[Public Domain Day]]), 2010. The Unlicense offers a public domain waiver text with a fall-back public-domain-like license, inspired by permissive licenses but without an [[Attribution (copyright)|attribution]] clause.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ostatic.com/blog/the-unlicense-a-license-for-no-license |title=The Unlicense: A License for No License |publisher=OStatic |author=Joe Brockmeier |date=January 11, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122063132/http://ostatic.com/blog/the-unlicense-a-license-for-no-license |archive-date=January 22, 2017}}</ref><ref name="unlicense_website">{{cite web |url=http://unlicense.org |title=Unlicense Yourself: Set Your Code Free |accessdate=February 28, 2017}}</ref> In 2015, [[GitHub]] reported that approximately 102,000 of their 5.1 million licensed projects (2% of licensed projects on GitHub.com) use the Unlicense.<ref name="githubunlicense">{{cite web|url=https://github.com/blog/1964-license-usage-on-github-com |title=Open source license usage on GitHub.com |date=2015-03-09 |first=Ben |last=Balter |accessdate=2015-11-21 |publisher=[[github.com]] |quote=1 MIT 44.69%, 2 Other 15.68%, 3 GPLv2 12.96%, 4 Apache 11.19%, 5 GPLv3 8.88%, 6 BSD 3-clause 4.53%, 7 Unlicense 1.87%, 8 BSD 2-clause 1.70%, 9 LGPLv3 1.30%, 10 AGPLv3 1.05%  (30 million × 2% × 17% = 102k)}}</ref>

==History==

In a post published on January 1 ([[Public Domain Day]]), 2010, Arto Bendiken outlined his reasons for preferring public domain software, namely: the nuisance of dealing with licensing terms, the [[Copyright infringement|threat inherent in copyright law]], and the impracticability of copyright law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ar.to/2010/01/set-your-code-free |date=January 1, 2010 |title=Set Your Code Free |author=Arto Bendiken |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |quote=anybody affixing a licensing statement to open-source software is guilty of either magical thinking or of having an intention to follow up on the implied threat}}</ref>

On January 23, 2010, Bendiken followed-up on his initial post. In this post, he explained that the Unlicense is based on the copyright waiver of [[SQLite]] with the no-warranty statement from the [[MIT License]]. He then walked through the license, commenting on each part.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ar.to/2010/01/dissecting-the-unlicense |title=Dissecting the Unlicense: Software Freedom in Four Clauses and a Link |author=Arto Bendiken |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |date=January 23, 2010}}</ref>

In a post published in December 2010, Bendiken further clarified what it means to "license" and "unlicense" software.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ar.to/2010/12/licensing-and-unlicensing |title=Licensed, License-Free, and Unlicensed Code |author=Arto Bendiken |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |date=December 19, 2010}}</ref>

On January 1, 2011, Bendiken reviewed the progress and adoption of the Unlicense. He admits that it is "difficult to give estimates of current Unlicense adoption" but suggests there are "many hundreds of projects using the Unlicense".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ar.to/2011/01/unlicense-1st-year |title=The Unlicense: The First Year in Review |author=Arto Bendiken |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |date=January 1, 2011}}</ref>

==Reception==

The [[Free Software Foundation]] states that "Both public domain works and the lax license provided by the Unlicense are compatible with the GNU GPL." However, for dedicating software to the public domain it recommends [[CC0]] over the Unlicense, stating that CC0 "is more thorough and mature than the Unlicense".<ref name="fsf_unlicense" />

The [[Fedora Project]] recommends CC0 over the Unlicense because the former is "a more comprehensive legal text".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing/Unlicense |title=Licensing/Unlicense |publisher=[[Fedora Project]] |accessdate=February 28, 2017 |date=August 14, 2014 |quote=Fedora recommends use of CC-0 over this license, because it is a more comprehensive legal text around this tricky issue. It is also noteworthy that some MIT variant licenses which contain the right to "sublicense" are closer to a true Public Domain declaration than the one in the "Unlicense" text.}}</ref>

In December 2010, [[Mike Linksvayer]], the vice president of [[Creative Commons]] at the time, wrote in an [[identi.ca]] conversation "I like the movement" in speaking of the Unlicense effort.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://identi.ca/conversation/59986314 |archive-date=August 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816083109/https://identi.ca/conversation/59986314 |title=Conversation |publisher=[[Identi.ca]] |accessdate=February 28, 2017 |date=December 17, 2010 |quote=@bendiken surely there's a better name than copyfree, but I like the movement and look fwd to your roundup. |author=[[Mike Linksvayer]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/unlicense/an9PHJ0NGxA |title=CC0 and the Unlicense |publisher=Google Groups |accessdate=February 28, 2017 |date=December 18, 2010 |author=Arto Bendiken |quote=In case it's of interest, I'm engaged in an ongoing Identi.ca conversation with Mike Linksvayer, the vice president of Creative Commons [&hellip;] In short, the folks at Creative Commons are aware of the Unlicense initiative, and apparently supportive of it.}}</ref>

The Unlicense has been criticized for: being possibly inconsistent; being non-standard, making it difficult for some projects to accept Unlicensed code as third-party contributions; leaving too much room for interpretation; and possibly being incoherent in some legal systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://github.com/docopt/docopt.rs/issues/1 |title=Use a working license instead of UNLICENSE |author=Val Markovic (Valloric) |date=July 6, 2014 |accessdate=February 9, 2017 |publisher=[[GitHub]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/147111/what-is-wrong-with-the-unlicense |title=What is wrong with the Unlicense? |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |author=cgt |publisher=Software Engineering Stack Exchange |date=May 3, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-review/2012-January/001386.html |title=[License-review] OSI, legal conditions outside the "four corners" of the license, and PD/CC 0 [was Re: Can OSI specify that public domain is open source?] |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |first=Rick |last=Moen |date=January 3, 2012 |publisher=Open Source Initiative}}</ref>
