The alien's non-immigrant status does not change as a result of their Form I-140 being approved.<ref name="immihelp_140" />

==Filing details==

The Form I-140 petition must be accompanied by what is termed "initial evidence". This evidence depends on the type of employee being sponsored, but for instance (in some cases) includes an award given to the employee or publication by the employee that certifies they are someone of extraordinary ability. In many cases (see table above), part of the initial evidence is a [[labor certification]], which establishes, among other things, that there are insufficient workers in the US to fill the position the alien employee plans to take.<ref name="i140_instructions" /> In cases where a labor certification is required, the petition is said to be labor certification-based.

In labor certification-based petitions, a [[labor certification]] must be filed and approved before Form I-140 can be submitted.<ref name="immihelp_140" /> The labor certification is valid for 180 days, and Form I-140 must be received by the USCIS before the labor certification expires.<ref name="i140_instructions" /><ref name="hooyoulc">{{cite web |url=http://www.hooyou.com/lc/faq.html |title= Frequently Asked Questions: PERM Labor Certification |accessdate=February 20, 2016}}</ref> It is possible to establish a successor-in-interest relationship between the successor employer and predecessor employer, in which case a predecessor's labor certification can be used.<ref name="wegreened_140" />

Additional evidence that must be provided includes the employer's financial data, proof of the employee's education and work experience, as well as evidence that the employer can pay the proffered wage to the employee.<ref name="greencardapply">{{cite web |url=http://www.greencardapply.com/i140.htm |title=Form I-140 Green Card DIY Package |accessdate=February 14, 2016 |publisher=Green Card Apply Service}}</ref>

The priority date of the Form I-140 application depends on whether the application is labor certification-based or not. If it is, the priority date is the date the [[Department of Labor]] receives the application; otherwise it is when the USCIS receives the application.<ref name="immihelp_140" />

The alien can in addition self-petition in the cases of [[EB-1 visa|EB1-A]] Alien of Extraordinary Ability or [[EB-2 visa|EB-2]] National Interest Waiver.<ref name="wegreened_140">{{cite web |url=http://www.wegreened.com/I-140-and-I-485-concurrent-filing |title=Frequently Asked Questions of Form I-140(Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker) and Concurrent Filing of I-140 and I-485 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |publisher=North America immigration Law Group}}</ref>
