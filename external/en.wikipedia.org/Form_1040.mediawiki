[[File:Form 1040, 2011.pdf|thumb|First page of Form 1040 for 2011 tax year]]

'''Form 1040''', (officially, the "U.S. Individual Income Tax Return"), is one of three forms (1040 [the "Long Form"], 1040A [the "Short Form"] and 1040EZâ€”see below for explanations of each) used for personal (individual) federal [[income tax]] returns filed with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS).

Income tax returns for individual calendar year taxpayers are due by April 15 of the next year, except when April 15 falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday.  In those circumstances, the returns are due on the next business day.  An automatic extension until Oct. 15 to file Form 1040 can be obtained by filing Form 4868.

Form 1040 consists of two full pages not counting attachments. The first page collects information about the taxpayer(s), dependents, income items, and adjustments to income. The second page calculates the allowable deductions and credits, tax due given the income figure, and applies funds already withheld from wages or estimated payments made towards the tax liability. At the top of the first page is the [[Presidential election campaign fund checkoff]], which allows you to designate that the federal government give $3 of the tax it receives to the Presidential election campaign fund.

==Filing requirements==

Filed by individuals as the chief form of the annual tax return (discuss what forms non-individuals file).

"These rules apply to all U.S. citizens, regardless of where they live, and resident aliens."<ref name="f1040_2014ins" />{{rp|6}} Resident aliens must be "resident [aliens] of the United States for tax purposes", which means they must pass either the [[Substantial Presence Test]] or the [[Green Card Test]], although they are not limited to just these cases.<ref name="alien_tax">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p519.pdf |title=U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens For use in preparing 2014 Returns |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}</ref>{{rp|3}} Resident aliens file Form 1040, 1040A, or 1040EZ like US citizens, but nonresident aliens must file Form 1040NR or 1040NR-EZ.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Aliens---Which-Form-to-File |title=Aliens - Which Form to File |publisher=Internal Revenue Service |accessdate=December 31, 2015}}</ref> Note that there is also a "dual status alien" for aliens whose status changed during the year.

Note that even if not required, individuals should still file a return in order to receive a refund on withheld income or to receive certain credits (e.g. [[Earned income tax credit]]).<ref name="f1040_2014ins" />{{rp|6}}

==Variants==

In addition to the standard Form 1040, there are also two variants: the 1040A and 1040EZ ("easy"). There is also the 1040X, which is used to make amendments to the 1040. Form 1040 and 1040A use the same line numbering up to and including line 9; Form 1040EZ uses completely different line numbering.

===1040A===

[[File:Form 1040a, 2011.pdf|thumb|Form 1040A, 2011]]

The '''1040A''' (nicknamed the "short form") is a shorter version of the standard Form 1040. It is limited to taxpayers with taxable income below $100,000 who take the [[standard deduction]] instead of [[itemized deduction|itemizing deductions]]. The 1040 can always be used instead of the 1040A, but the 1040A can only be used when the restrictions apply.<ref name="1040a_turbo">{{cite web |url=https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/IRS-Tax-Forms/What-is-the-IRS-1040A-Form-/INF14500.html |title=What is the IRS 1040A Form? |publisher=TurboTax |accessdate=December 31, 2015}}</ref>

A taxpayer who uses the 1040A tax return can only have income from the following sources:
*Wages, salaries, and tips.
*Interest and ordinary dividends.
*[[Capital gain]]s distributions.
*Taxable scholarships and fellowship grants.
*Pensions, [[annuity|annuities]], and [[Individual Retirement Account|IRA]]s.
*Unemployment compensation.
*Taxable [[social security]] and railroad retirement benefits.
*[[Alaska Permanent Fund]] dividends.

Several other restrictions apply as well.

===1040EZ===

[[File:F1040ez 2011.pdf|thumb|Form 1040EZ, 2011]]

The '''1040EZ''' (officially called Income Tax Return for Single and Joint Filers with No Dependents, but nicknamed the "easy form") is a simplified, six-section version of the 1040. Its use is limited to taxpayers with taxable income below $100,000 who take the [[standard deduction]] instead of itemizing deductions.<ref name="ez_investo">{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/071514/whats-difference-between-irs-forms-1040ez-and-1040a.asp |accessdate=December 31, 2015 |title=What's the difference between IRS Forms 1040EZ and 1040A? |publisher=Investopedia}}</ref>

Other restrictions for 2005 include:<ref name="ez_investo" />

* Filing status must be single or married filing jointly.
* Filer must be under age 65 on January 1 and not blind at the end of the year of the filing.
* Filers must not claim any dependents (other than themselves).
* No adjustments to income can be claimed.
* The only credit that can be claimed is the [[Earned Income Credit]] (EIC).
* The only income to report for the tax year consisted of wages, salaries, tips, taxable scholarship or fellowship grants, unemployment compensation, or [[Alaska Permanent Fund]] dividends, and filer's taxable interest was not over $1500.  But if the filer earned tips, including allocated tips, that are not included in box 5 and box 7 of your [[Form W-2]], filer may not be able to use Form 1040EZ.
* Filer did not receive any advanced EIC payments.

For the tax year 2006, there was also the EZ-T variant. It was used to only claim the Phone Long Distance Tax credit, when they otherwise are not required to file.

===1040X===

[[File:F1040x 2011.pdf|thumb|Form 1040X, 2011]]

The '''1040X''' (officially, the Amended U.S. Individual Tax Return) is used to make corrections on Form 1040, Form 1040A, and Form 1040EZ tax returns that have been previously filed.

Generally for a [[tax refund]], this form must be filed within 3 years after the date that the original version was filed, or within 2 years after the date that the tax was paid, whichever is later. For a 1040X based on a bad debt or worthless security, it must be filed within 7 years after the due date of the original version. A 1040X that is filed immediately before the due date of the original version is considered "on time".

Form 1040X is similar to Form 1040 except that it has three columns: one column to list the amounts from the original version, one column to list the net increase or decrease for each line being changed, and the last column to list the new amounts.

Certain "financial timing" type changes cannot simply be made with the 1040X, and must be requested through the much more complicated Form 3115 (Change of Accounting Method). The least obvious (and most common) example of such a restricted change is in correcting past years' business or rental depreciation. Beyond that, Form 3115 also lists over 50 other specific change types. Many of those include classic bookkeeping concerns, such as when to recognize revenue and expenses.
==Schedules and extra forms==

Form 1040 has 14 attachments, called "schedules", which may need to be filed depending on the taxpayer. For 2009 and 2010 there was an additional form, {{visible anchor|Schedule M}}, due to the "[[Making Work Pay tax credit|Making Work Pay]]" provision of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] ("the stimulus").

In 2014 there were two additions to Form 1040 due to the implementation of  the [[Affordable Care Act]]â€”the [[premium tax credit]] and the [[individual mandate]].<ref>http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2014/11/04/irs-commissioner-predicts-miserable-2015-tax-filing-season/</ref>

In most situations, other [[Internal Revenue Service]] or [[Social Security Administration]] forms such as Form W-2 must be attached to the Form 1040, in addition to the Form 1040 schedules.  There are over 100 other specialized forms that may need to be completed along with Schedules and the Form 1040.<ref name="listofforms">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/taxyr2014_form1040_series_and_attachments.pdf |title=Forms &amp; Attachments Listing 1040/1040SSPR/1040-A/1040-EZ |date=September 5, 2014 |accessdate=December 31, 2015 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}</ref>

==Estimated payments and withholding==

For most individuals, [[Tax withholding in the United States|withholding]] is the main way through which taxes are paid. However, income that is not subject to withholding must be estimated using Form 1040-ES. (It may be possible to avoid filing Form 1040-ES by increasing one's withholding and instead filing a Form W-4.)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040es.pdf |title=Form 1040-ES 2015: Estimated Tax for Individuals |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}</ref>

Estimated payments can be made using the [[Electronic Federal Tax Payment System]].

==Payments, refunds, and penalties==

{{main|IRS penalties}}

There is a three-year limit to when individuals can claim a tax refund. However, payments that are due must be paid immediately.<ref name="efile_penalties">{{cite web |url=http://www.efile.com/what-are-the-penalties-for-not-filing-a-tax-return-or-not-to-pay-taxes-IRS-penalty-list/ |title=IRS Penalties for Not Filing a Tax Return or Not Paying Taxes Owed |publisher=efile.com |accessdate=December 31, 2015}}</ref>

In addition it is possible to apply one's refunds to next year's taxes<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1901277-how-do-i-apply-my-refund-to-next-year-s-taxes |title= How do I apply my refund to next year's taxes?  |publisher=TurboTax |accessdate=December 31, 2015}}</ref> and also to change one's mind later.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1901186-what-if-i-chose-to-apply-my-federal-refund-to-next-year-s-taxes-filed-and-later-changed-my-mind |title= What if I chose to apply my federal refund to next year's taxes, filed, and later changed my mind?  |accessdate=December 31, 2015 |publisher=TurboTax}}</ref>

There is a penalty for not filing a tax return by April 15 that depends on whether the individual got a filing extension and the amount of unpaid taxes. However, since the maximum penalty is 25% of unpaid taxes, if an individual has paid all their taxes, there is no penalty for not filing.<ref name="efile_penalties" /><ref name="eight_facts">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/Eight-Facts-on-Late-Filing-and-Late-Payment-Penalties |title=Eight Facts on Late Filing and Late Payment Penalties |accessdate=December 31, 2015 |date=April 18, 2013 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}</ref>

==History==

The first Form 1040 was published for use for the tax years 1913, 1914, and 1915. For 1916, Form 1040 was converted to an annual form (i.e., updated each year with the new tax year printed on the form).<ref>See Publication 1796-A, ''IRS Historical Tax Products'' (rev. Feb. 2007), Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury.</ref> Initially, the IRS mailed tax booklets (Form 1040, instructions, and most common attachments) to all households. As alternative delivery methods (CPA/Attorneys, Internet forms) increased in popularity, the IRS sent fewer packets via mail. In 2009 this practice was discontinued.

With the [[Current Tax Payment Act of 1943]], income tax withholding was introduced. The [[Individual Income Tax Act of 1944]] created standard deductions on the 1040.<ref name="historical_highlights">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/Historical-Highlights-of-the-IRS |title=Historical Highlights of the IRS |accessdate=December 31, 2015 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}</ref>

In 1954 the tax return deadline was changed to April 15.<ref name="historical_highlights" />

Form 1040A was introduced in 1941 to simplify the filing process.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tax History: The Love-Hate Relationship With the Standard Deduction |first=Joseph J. |last=Thorndike |url=http://www.taxhistory.org/thp/readings.nsf/ArtWeb/FD4865793851996185257D1B0041C875?OpenDocument |accessdate=December 31, 2015 |publisher=Tax History Project}}</ref>

Form 1040EZ was introduced by the Internal Revenue Service for the 1982 tax year. The title of the 1982 form was "Income Tax Return for Single filers with no dependents."

==Analogs in other countries==

In the [[United Kingdom]], various returns such as the SA100 must be filed (see [[Tax return (United Kingdom)]] for more).

In [[Japan]], most people do not need to file a tax return due to income withholding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2206.html |title=Taxes in Japan|publisher=Japan Guide |accessdate=December 31, 2015}}</ref>
