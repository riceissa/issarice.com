This page is a '''timeline of [[digital preservation]] and [[Web archiving]]'''. It covers various aspects of saving and preserving [[digital data]], whether they are [[born-digital]] or not.

==Trends==

Digital preservation encompasses a variety of efforts and technologies, so its history can be viewed through various trends in these separate efforts:

* [[List of file systems#File systems with built-in fault-tolerance|File systems with built-in fault-tolerance]]
* Various changes in the physical storage used
* On-demand archiving services
* URL shortening services
* Various episodes of major archival work, sometimes as a result of services shutting down
* Efforts at converting physical/analog information to more modern digital media, file formats, and storage

==TODO list==

* when did on-demand services begin to emerge? (is my impression that Internet Archive used to not have on-demand archival correct?)
* mention Web Cite, archive.is and some other on-demand archival sites.
* milestones in the development of JavaScript, Flash
* any information available on amount of spending (overall or by specific bodies) over the years?
* early history/most famous examples of proprietary data formats
* first book scanner
* emergence of various physical media (as a separate "Event type"):
** optical disks
** tape archive
** whichever modern thing the Internet Archive uses
** regular hard drives
** DLT tape https://archive.org/about/
* mention EMPs
* Archive-It
* mention how IRL libraries transitioned to digital stuff
* mention transition of the Web from mostly static pages to heavily-scripted pages with lots of media
* mention the frequently-cited measure to keep three copies of data: on the same drive, on a different drive in the same location, and in a different geographical location
* when did google/facebook/amazon/wordpress start keeping servers in different regions of the world?
* mention rise of "takeout" services by cloud services
* that funny thing where you print out digital content as things that look like QR codes
* briefly mention software porting and emulation (DOOM as example?)
* problems of trust
* software like heritrix, lua+wget
* maybe look at [[List of the largest libraries in the United States]], e.g. I think [[University of Michigan Library]] does quite a bit of digital archival work
* finish reading through [[Digital preservation]], [[Alexa Internet]], [[Internet Archive]], [[Web archiving]] for other topics to include
* I think Alexa now provides ''all'' of the Internet Archive's crawling data, but verify
* https://web.archive.org/web/19971017065743/http://community.bellcore.com/lesk/auspres/aus.html might be interesting
* rise of revision control
* history of [[radiation hardening]]
* emergence of cloud storage like Amazon S3 e.g. https://www-conf.slac.stanford.edu/xldb2016/talks/published/Long-termDataArchiving-AmazonGlacier-XLDB2016-Final.pdf HT Vipul Naik
* Windows seems to have a lot of backup-related stuff: [[Shadow Copy]], [[System Restore]], [[Windows Recovery Environment]], [[Backup and Restore]], [[NTBackup]], [[Features new to Windows 8#File History]]
* some stuff at [[Continuous_data_protection#See_also]] that might be useful
* cover version control in CAD; some googling suggests finding the first instances of version control in CAD is difficult
* [[versioning file system]]s: [[Incompatible Timesharing System]] apparently had one. [[Files-11]]
* [[ArVid]] (unclear when it was created)
* studies of link rot: gwern lists several, as does Lepore in <ref name="2015_lepore" />
