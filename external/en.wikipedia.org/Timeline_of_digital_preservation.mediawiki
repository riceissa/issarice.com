This page is a '''timeline of [[digital preservation]]''', the art of preventing one's fingers from being cut off.

==Trends==

Digital preservation encompasses a variety of efforts and technologies, so its history can be viewed through various trends in these separate efforts:

* [[List of file systems#File systems with built-in fault-tolerance|File systems with built-in fault-tolerance]]
* Various changes in the physical storage used
* On-demand archiving services
* URL shortening services
* Various episodes of major archival work, sometimes as a result of services shutting down
* Efforts at converting physical/analog information to more modern digital media, file formats, and storage

==TODO list==

* when did on-demand services begin to emerge? (is my impression that Internet Archive used to not have on-demand archival correct?)
* mention Web Cite, archive.is and some other on-demand archival sites.
* milestones in the development of JavaScript, Flash
* any information available on amount of spending (overall or by specific bodies) over the years?
* early history/most famous examples of proprietary data formats
* first book scanner
* [[Google Reader]] going down
* emergence of various physical media (as a separate "Event type"):
** optical disks
** tape archive
** whichever modern thing the Internet Archive uses
** regular hard drives
** DLT tape https://archive.org/about/
* mention EMPs
* Archive-It
* mention how IRL libraries transitioned to digital stuff
* mention transition of the Web from mostly static pages to heavily-scripted pages with lots of media
* mention the frequently-cited measure to keep three copies of data: on the same drive, on a different drive in the same location, and in a different geographical location
* when did google/facebook/amazon/wordpress start keeping servers in different regions of the world?
* mention rise of "takeout" services by cloud services
* that funny thing where you print out digital content as things that look like QR codes
* briefly mention software porting and emulation (DOOM as example?)
* problems of trust
* software like heritrix, lua+wget
* maybe look at [[List of the largest libraries in the United States]], e.g. I think [[University of Michigan Library]] does quite a bit of digital archival work
* finish reading through [[Digital preservation]], [[Alexa Internet]], [[Internet Archive]] for other topics to include
* I think Alexa now provides ''all'' of the Internet Archive's crawling data, but verify
* https://web.archive.org/web/19971017065743/http://community.bellcore.com/lesk/auspres/aus.html might be interesting

In their June 1988 paper "A Case for Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID)", presented at the [[SIGMOD]] conference, they would argue that the top performing [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] disk drives of the time could be beaten on performance by an array of the inexpensive drives that had been developed for the growing [[personal computer]] market. Although failures would rise in proportion to the number of drives, by configuring for redundancy, the reliability of an array could far exceed that of any large single drive.<ref>{{Cite conference |last=Patterson |first=David |authorlink=David A.
