! Time period !! Key developments
|-
| 1851–1915 || Understanding of and interest in schistosomiasis deepens as more people come in contact with the disease.
|-
| 1948–present || Following [[World War II]], the [[World Health Organization]] "has been the principal body concerned with the international support of research and control programmes" of schistosomiasis.<ref name=sandbach/>{{rp|266}} However despite this and the implementation of programs, prevalence of schistosomiasis increases in many areas.<ref name=sandbach/>{{rp|262}}
|-
| 1949–1997 || Both Japan and South Korea successfully implement national programs to essentially eliminate soil-transmitted helminthiasis.
|-
| 2001–present || The World Health Assembly declares deworming as a focus. Various deworming organizations form.
