The [[George Mason University]] economist [[Bryan Caplan]], writing for the economics blog [[EconLog]], said "its members seem to lean heavily [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]" and that "the IGM ought to at least explicitly disclose its panelists' political allegiances".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/07/igm_and_economi.html |author=Bryan Caplan |date=July 27, 2012 |title=IGM, Economic Consensus, and Partisan Bias |publisher=EconLog |accessdate=July 8, 2016}}</ref>
