'''Form W-9''', (officially, the "Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification"<ref name="actual_w9">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf |title=Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification |accessdate=January 22, 2016 |date=2014}}</ref>), is used in the [[Taxation in the United States|United States]] [[income tax]] system by a third party who must file an information return with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS).<ref name="internal1">Internal Revenue Code § 31.3406(h)-3</ref> It requests the name, address, and [[Taxpayer Identification Number|taxpayer identification information]] of a taxpayer (in the form of a [[Social Security Number]] or [[Employer Identification Number]]).

The form is never actually sent to the IRS, but is maintained by the individual who files the information return for verification purposes. The information on the Form W-9 and the payment made are reported on a Form 1099.<ref>Internal Revenue Code § 1.6041-1</ref>

==Use cases==

===Business–contractor arrangement===

Form W-9 is most commonly used in a business–contractor arrangement.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/IRS-Tax-Forms/What-Is-IRS-Form-W9-/INF14813.html |title=What Is IRS Form W-9? |accessdate=January 22, 2016 |date=2015}}</ref> Businesses can use Form W-9 to request information from contractors they hire. When a business pays a contractor at least $600 during a tax year, the business is required to file [[Form 1099-MISC]], a variant of [[Form 1099]]. To fill out Form 1099-MISC, the business may need information (such as address and Tax Identification Number) from the contractor, for which Form W-9 is used. The business does not send Form W-9 to the IRS.<ref name="investopedia_w9">{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/082714/purpose-w9-form.asp |title= The Purpose Of The W-9 Form |accessdate=January 22, 2016 |date=November 24, 2015 |last=Fontinelle |first=Amy}}</ref>

===Avoiding backing withholding===

Another purpose of Form W-9 is to help the payee avoid [[backup withholding]]. The payer must collect [[Withholding tax|withholding taxes]] on certain reportable payments for the IRS. However, if the payee certifies on the W-9 they are not subject to backup withholding they generally receive the full payment due them from the payer.<ref name="internal1"/> This is similar to the withholding exemptions certifications found on Form W-4 for employees.

===Financial institution–customer arrangement===

Financial institutions sometimes send Form W-9 to a customer to request information. However, it is not necessarily required for the customer to fill out the form, since the institution likely already has the requested information (when the customer opened an account).<ref name="investopedia_w9" />

===Employer–employee arrangement===

In an employer–employee arrangement, Form W-9 and Form 1099 should not be used. Instead, the corresponding Form W-4 (to provide information) and Form W-2 (to report amount paid) should be filed instead.<ref name="investopedia_w9" />
