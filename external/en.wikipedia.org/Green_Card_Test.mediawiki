The '''Green Card Test''' ('''GCT''') is a criterion used by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) in the [[United States]] to determine whether an individual qualifies as a "resident for tax purposes". The GCT asks whether, during the [[calendar year]], an individual spent at least one day in the US as a [[Permanent residence (United States)|lawful permanent resident]] (i.e. possessed a green card).<ref name="argct">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Alien-Residency---Green-Card-Test |title=Alien Residency - Green Card Test |publisher=Internal Revenue Service |accessdate=January 4, 2016}}</ref><ref name="irsgct" /> In particular, it is not required to possess a green card when the individual files a return. The GCT is used alongside the [[Substantial Presence Test]]; specifically, an alien is considered a "resident for tax purposes" if they pass either the GCT or the Substantial Presence Test.<ref name="irsgct">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/The-Green-Card-Test-and-the-Substantial-Presence-Test |title=The Green Card Test and the Substantial Presence Test |accessdate=January 4, 2016 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}</ref>

==Exceptions==

There exists an exception to the Green Card Test if an individual stops being a lawful permanent resident during the calendar year. Specifically, if an individual voluntarily renounces and abandons resident status by writing to the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS), if the USCIS administratively terminates the individual's immigrant status, or if a US federal court judicially terminates the individual's immigrant status, then the individual no longer holds US resident status, and moreover fails the GCT.<ref name="argct" />

==Providing documentation==

[[Form W-9]] is used to inform the withholding agent that an individual is a "resident for tax purposes".<ref>{{cite web |title=Resident Alien vs. Legal Permanent Resident |url=http://controller.richmond.edu/payroll/international/residency.html |accessdate=January 5, 2016 |publisher=University of Richmond Controller's Office}}</ref>

Passing the Green Card Test guarantees that an individual will be treated as a "resident for tax purposes" for the entire year. However, a withholding agent must wait until receiving an official document from the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] to treat the individual as a "resident for tax purposes".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://admnacct.csusb.edu/reportingAndTax/FAQs.html#q05 |title=Non-Resident Aliens (NRA) Frequently Asked Questions, Question 5 What is the "Green Card Test"? |accessdate=January 5, 2016}}</ref>

==Residency for tax purposes does not imply permanent residency==

It is possible to be a resident for tax purposes in the United States but to ''not'' be a permanent resident of the United States. A non-citizen can be a permanent resident of the United States only if he/she holds a [[United States Permanent Resident Card|Green Card]]. On the other hand, people on non-immigrant visas may well be treated as residents for tax purposes.
