The '''Global Burden of Disease Study''' ('''GBD''') is a comprehensive regional and global research program of [[disease burden]] that assesses [[death|mortality]] and [[disability]] from major diseases, injuries, and [[risk factor]]s. GBD is a collaboration of over 1,800 researchers from 127 countries. Under principal investigator [[Christopher J.L. Murray]], GBD is based out of the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] (IHME) at the [[University of Washington]] and funded by the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=What does a $100 million public health data revolution look like?|url=http://www.tedmed.com/talks/show?id=17751|website=TEDMED}}</ref>

==History==

The Global Burden of Disease Study began in 1990 as a single [[World Bank]]-commissioned<ref name="sign">{{cite web |url=http://www.healthdata.org/announcement/institute-health-metrics-and-evaluation-and-world-health-organization-sign-new |title=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and World Health Organization sign new agreement |publisher=[[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] |accessdate=January 29, 2017 |date=May 2015}}</ref> study, now called GBD 1990.<ref name="aboutgbd" /> The original project quantified the health effects of more than 100 diseases and injuries for eight regions of the world, giving estimates of [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] by age, sex, and region. It also introduced the [[disability-adjusted life year]] (DALY) as a new metric to quantify the burden of diseases, injuries, and [[risk factor]]s,<ref name="pruss-ustun2003">{{cite book|first1=Annette|last1=Prüss-Üstün|first2=C.|last2=Mathers|first3=Carlos|last3=Corvalán|first4=A.|last4=Woodward|title=Assessing the environmental burden of disease at national and local levels: Introduction and methods|year=2003|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9241546204|series=WHO Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=1|url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/9241546204/en/index.html}}</ref><ref name="aboutgbd">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/about/en/index.html|title=About the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project|work=Health statistics and health information systems|publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref><ref name="globalburden">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/|title=Global burden of disease|publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref> to aid comparisons.

In 2000–2002, the 1990 study was updated by WHO to include a more extensive analysis using a framework known as ''comparative risk factor assessment''.<ref name="aboutgbd" />

==Aims==

The GBD has three specific aims:

#To systematically incorporate information on non-fatal outcomes into the assessment of the health status (using a time-based measure of healthy years of life lost due either to premature mortality or to years lived with a disability, weighted by the severity of that disability)
#To ensure that all estimates and projections were derived on the basis of objective epidemiological and demographic methods, which were not influenced by advocates.
#To measure the burden of disease using a metric that could also be used to assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions. The metric chosen was the DALY.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The burden of disease can be viewed as the gap between current health status and an ideal situation in which everyone lives into old age free of disease and disability. Causes of the gap are premature mortality, disability and exposure to certain risk factors that contribute to illness.

==Results==

The 2013 report showed that global [[life expectancy]] for both sexes increased from 65.3 years in 1990, to 71.5 years in 2013,<ref name="Lancet2014">{{cite journal|author=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators| date=2014|title=Global, regional, and national age–sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=The Lancet|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–171|issn=0140-6736|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|pmid=25530442|pmc=4340604}}</ref> while the number of deaths increased from 47.5 million to 54.9 million over the same interval.<ref name="Lancet2014" /> Progress varied widely across [[demographic]] and national groups. Reductions in age-standardised death rates for [[cardiovascular diseases]] and [[cancers]] in high-income regions, and reductions in child deaths from [[diarrhoea]], [[lower respiratory infections]] and neonatal causes in low-income regions drove the changes. [[HIV/AIDS]] reduced life expectancy in southern [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

For most communicable causes of death both numbers of deaths and age-standardised death rates fell, while for most non-communicable causes, demographic shifts increased numbers of deaths but decreased age-standardised death rates.

Global deaths from injury increased by 10.7%, from 4.3 million deaths in 1990 to 4.8 million in 2013; but age-standardised rates declined over the same period by 21%.<ref name="Lancet2014" /> For some causes of more than 100,000 deaths per year in 2013, age-standardised death rates increased between 1990 and 2013, including HIV/AIDS, [[pancreatic cancer]], [[atrial fibrillation]] and flutter, drug use disorders, [[diabetes]], [[chronic kidney disease]] and [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle-cell anaemias]]. Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, neonatal causes and malaria remain in the top five causes of death in children younger than 5 years. The most important [[pathogens]] are [[rotavirus]] for diarrhoea and [[pneumococcus]] for lower respiratory infections.<ref name="Lancet2014" />

GBD 2015 found that for the first time, annual deaths from [[measles]] had fallen below 100,000 in 2013 and 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2016/11/16/vaccinations-vaccine-science-and-a-new-us-president/ |title=Vaccinations, Vaccine Science, and a New US President {{!}} Speaking of Medicine |publisher=[[PLOS]] |date=November 17, 2016 |accessdate=January 31, 2017 |author=Peter Hotez |quote=Those results include new findings just released by the Gates Foundation-supported Global Burden of Disease 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators that found a 75 percent reduction in global measles mortality over the last decade such that (for the first time ever) fewer than 100,000 children died from measles in 2013 and 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTableImage?tableId=tbl3&pii=S0140673614616822 |title=Table 3: Selected causes of global child deaths in 1990 and 2013 |accessdate=January 31, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTableImage?tableId=tbl5&pii=S0140673616310121 |title=Table 5: Global deaths in 2005 and 2015 for all ages and both sexes combined and age-standardised death rates, with percentage change between 2005 and 2015 for 249 causes |accessdate=January 31, 2017}}</ref> It also found that the global annual rate of new HIV infections has largely stayed the same during the past 10 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/global-rate-of-new-hiv-infections-hasn-t-fallen-in-a-decade-1.20305 |publisher=Nature News & Comment |title=Global rate of new HIV infections hasn't fallen in a decade |accessdate=February 2, 2017 |author=Nisha Gaind |date=July 25, 2016}}</ref>
