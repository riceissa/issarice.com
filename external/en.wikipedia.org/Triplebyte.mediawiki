==Hiring philosophy==

Triplebyte thinks each startup has different ideas on what a "great engineer" is.<ref name="tc_3m" />

Triplebyte does not accept resumes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/coding-bootcamps-vs-computer-science-degrees-2016-5 |title=The truth about whether 'coding bootcamps' that can get graduates $100,000 exit salaries actually prepare you to be a programmer |date= May 19, 2016 |accessdate=June 5, 2016 |author=Nathan McAlone |publisher=''[[Business Insider]]''}}</ref> Instead, it conducts a two-part technical evaluation,<ref name=fastcompany>{{cite web |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3059901/why-this-tech-recruiting-platform-doesnt-accept-resumes |title=Why This Tech Recruiting Platform Doesn't Accept Resumes |accessdate=2016-06-03 |author=Lydia Dishman |date=2016-05-16 |publisher=Fast Company}}</ref> and only asks about a candidate's education after they have passed the technical interview.<ref name="fortune">{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2016/05/19/triplebyte-coding-bootcamp-study/ |title=Can ‘Coding Bootcamps’ Fix The Shortage of Engineers? |accessdate=June 3, 2016 |date=May 19, 2016 |last=Kokalitcheva |first=Kia |publisher=Fortune}}</ref>

==Business model==

Triplebyte takes from companies 25% of the first-year salary of those it helps to hire, with a six-month period for refunds.<ref name="tc" /> The software engineers that are hired through Triplebyte do not pay Triplebyte.

The company also collects data on what makes a good [[software engineer]], which could help to automate the interviewing process.<ref name="tc" />
