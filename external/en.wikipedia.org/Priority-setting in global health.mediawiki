In [[global health]], '''priority-setting''' is a term used for the process and strategy of deciding which health interventions to carry out. Priority-setting can be conducted at the disease level (i.e. deciding which disease to alleviate), the overall strategy level (i.e. [[selective primary healthcare]] versus [[primary healthcare]] versus more general [[health systems strengthening]]), research level (i.e. which health research to carry out),<ref name=rudan2007/> or other levels.<ref name=durand />{{rp|5}}

==Definitions==

Priority-setting is the act of deciding which health interventions to carry out, and can occur at several levels of granularity. Priority-setting can occur at the following levels:<ref name=rudan2007/><ref name=durand />{{rp|5}}<ref name="pmac2016">{{cite web |url=http://globalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/CallForAbstract.pdf |title=Call for Abstracts: Priority Setting for Universal Health Coverage |accessdate=June 23, 2016 |publisher=Prince Mahidol Award Conference 2016}}</ref>

* health budget level (i.e. deciding how much to spend on health overall)
* overall strategy level (i.e. [[selective primary healthcare]] versus [[primary healthcare]] versus more general [[health systems strengthening]])
* disease level (i.e. deciding which disease to alleviate)
* intervention level within each disease (i.e. restricting to a specific disease and prioritizing among interventions for that disease)
* drug level
* research level (i.e. which health research to carry out)

Synonymous terms include "prioritization in health care and health research", "priority determination", "health priorities",<ref name=rudan2010/> and "agenda-setting".<ref>{{Cite journal| volume = 370| issue = 9595| pages = 1370–1379| last1 = Shiffman| first1 = Jeremy| last2 = Smith| first2 = Stephanie| title = Generation of political priority for global health initiatives: a framework and case study of maternal mortality| journal = The Lancet| accessdate = 2016-07-26| date = 2007| url = http://www.who.int/pmnch/topics/advocacy/JShiffman-globalsmarticle-Lancet.pdf }}</ref>

==Metrics==

Various metrics have been used to compare interventions. These include:

* [[Disability-adjusted life year]] per unit cost (used by e.g. [[Disease Control Priorities Project]]),<ref name=rudan2010/><ref name="glassman2012">{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.gheart.2012.01.007| issn = 22118160| volume = 7| issue = 1| pages = 13–34| last1 = Glassman| first1 = Amanda| last2 = Chalkidou| first2 = Kalipso| last3 = Giedion| first3 = Ursula| last4 = Teerawattananon| first4 = Yot| last5 = Tunis| first5 = Sean| last6 = Bump| first6 = Jesse B.| last7 = Pichon-Riviere| first7 = Andres| title = Priority-Setting Institutions in Health| journal = Global Heart| accessdate = 2016-06-23| date = March 2012| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211816012000105}}</ref> [[quality-adjusted life year]], and other forms of [[cost-effectiveness analysis]]

* Adequacy of funding<ref name=dcp2_ch4 />

==Who sets the priorities?==

Priority-setting can be done by various actors. These include:

* Governments: "In most countries, health spending by governments vastly outpaces international health aid, so governments set most health priorities."<ref name="glassman2013">{{cite web |url=http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Glassman%2011-13-13%20(public).pdf |title=A conversation with Amanda Glassman on November 13, 2013 |date=November 13, 2013 |accessdate=June 21, 2016 |publisher=[[GiveWell]]}}</ref>
* Non-profits and companies that assist governments
* If a country is using a [[Health in All Policy]] (HiAP) approach, then priority-setting is done by stakeholders who do not directly deal with health.<ref name=pmac2016/>
* International organizations
* Foundations
* Private donors (including [[high-net-worth individual]]s and ultra-high-net-worth individuals): "A common outcome is a negotiated set of priorities that reflect some domestic needs and some technical, political, and economic considerations defined largely by the interests of donors."<ref name=glassman2012/> In some highly aid-dependent countries, donors "have huge influence on health priorities".<ref name=glassman2013/>

According to Devi Sridhar, professor of global health at the [[University of Edinburgh]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cphs.mvm.ed.ac.uk/people/staffProfile.php?profile=dsridhar |date=September 30, 2015 |title=Centre for Population Health Sciences - People |accessdate=July 27, 2016}}</ref> "the priorities of funding bodies largely dictate what health issues and diseases are studied".<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001312| issn = 1549-1676| volume = 9| issue = 9| pages = –1001312| last = Sridhar| first = Devi| title = Who Sets the Global Health Research Agenda?

==History of organizations and programs working on priority-setting==

According to [[Amanda Glassman]] et al., global-level priority-setting has occurred since at least the 1980s, though these efforts have only focused on a few aspects.<ref name=glassman2012 />

The following table is a timeline of organizations and programs working on priority-setting.

<!-- Merge info from [[University_of_Toronto_Joint_Centre_for_Bioethics#Priority_Setting]]:

Priority setting, or resource allocation, is an important health policy issue that occurs at all levels of health care. The Joint Centre for Bioethics shares its research platform on priority setting with the Canadian Priority Setting Research Network, which aims to improve the politics and processes of health care priority setting and enhance the research capacity for priority setting. The centre takes an innovative approach to priority setting research in that the focus is placed on enhancing the priority setting processes, capturing and sharing actual priority setting experiences, and taking a bottom-up approach to improve priority setting.

==Reception==

{{cquote|text=The result of a myriad of actors championing a kaleidoscope of "priorities" is confusion. Advocates, researchers, and policy makers have labeled almost every disease, condition, medication, or intervention a "health priority."|author=Glassman et al.<ref name=glassman2012/>}}

Rudan et al. says that priority-setting efforts have relied on "consensus reached by panels of experts" and as a result have not been systematic enough, and that this has "often made it difficult to present the identified priorities to wider audiences as legitimate and fair".<ref name=rudan2007/>

[[Amanda Glassman|Glassman]] et al. notes that criticisms of priority-setting include "the weak data on which estimates of burden, cost, and effectiveness relied; the value judgments implicit in disability-adjusted life year age weighting and discounting decisions; and treatment of equity issues, as well as the political difficulties associated with translating a ground zero package into a public budget based on historical inputs"; and the consideration of only health maximization at the expense of other objectives such as fairness.<ref name=glassman2012 />{{rp|16}}

Glassman et al. also notes how there are more cost-effectiveness studies for LMICs (in the thousands), but that these are unlikely to be actually applied to priority-setting processes.<ref name=glassman2012 />{{rp|16}}

[[Jeremy Shiffman]] has said that some bodies such as the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] and ''[[The Lancet]]'' are prominent in priority-setting due to their dominion rather than data and analysis, and also notes that the process of creating the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] was not sufficiently transparent.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.15171/ijhpm.2015.51| issn = 2322-5939| volume = 4| issue = 5| pages = 315–317| last = Levine| first = Ruth E.| title = Power in global health agenda-setting: the role of private funding| journal = International Journal of Health Policy and Management| accessdate = 2016-07-22| date = 2015-03-04| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4417636/| pmid = 25905483| pmc = 4417636}}</ref>
