The '''professional consensus of economics''' refers to the phenomenon of convergence of views of economists on issues that are contentious among noneconomists. The convergence of views happens mainly in [[microeconomics]]; in [[macroeconomics]] professional opinion can be divided.<ref name=ceepreface /><ref name=sumner_astro /><ref name=taylor_praxtime /><ref name=kearl_1979 />{{rp|33}}

==History==

In 1979, [[James R. Kearl]], [[Clayne L. Pope]], [[Gordon C. Whiting]], and [[Larry T. Wimmer]] published "A Confusion of Economists?"<ref name=kearl_1979>{{Cite journal| issn = 0002-8282| volume = 69| issue = 2| pages = 28–37| last1 = Kearl| first1 = J.

Writing in 1992, the [[Pitzer College]] economist [[Linus Yamane]] said that "the most common complaint" of economists by noneconomists is that they "never agree", but then points out that "[on] many issues economists are quite unanimous in their opinion". Nevertheless, Yamane argues that this consensus is ignored and that "politics always dominates economics".<ref name="yamane">{{cite web |url=http://bernard.pitzer.edu/~lyamane/fun.htm |author=Linus Yamane  |title=Why do people make fun of economists? |accessdate=July 9, 2016 |date=February 1992}}</ref>

In 1993, economist [[David R. Henderson]] noted in the preface to ''[[The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics]]'' the popular perception that "economists never agree", but countered by saying "[while] economists disagree on many matters, they have reached virtually unanimous agreement on a multitude of others".<ref name=ceepreface>{{cite web |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/bios/CEEPreface.html |editor=David R. Henderson |date=December 15, 2001 |title=Preface and Acknowledgments to ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics'' |publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty |accessdate=July 10, 2016}}</ref>

[[Harvard University]] macroeconomist [[Greg Mankiw]] noted the consensus among economists in 2006<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/11/consensus-of-economists.html |date=November 30, 2006 |author=Greg Mankiw |website=Greg Mankiw's Blog |title=The Consensus of Economists |accessdate=July 9, 2016}}</ref> and again in 2009<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2009/02/news-flash-economists-agree.html |date=February 14, 2009 |author=Greg Mankiw |title=News Flash: Economists Agree |website=Greg Mankiw's Blog |accessdate=July 9, 2016}}</ref> on his blog.

In 2012, [[University of Chicago]] economist [[Steven Levitt]] shared the [[Initiative on Global Markets Forum]] survey results available at the time (which show broad agreement among economists), and added that in his experience, "[most] economists think very much alike."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://freakonomics.com/2012/01/09/if-all-the-economists-were-laid-end-to-end-would-they-reach-a-conclusion/ |author=by Steven D. Levitt |date=January 9, 2012 |title=If All the Economists Were Laid End to End, Would They Reach a Conclusion? |publisher=Freakonomics |accessdate=July 9, 2016}}</ref>
 
In 2013, [[Roger H. Gordon]] and [[Gordon B. Dahl]] published the paper "Views among Economists: Professional Consensus or Point-Counterpoint?" using survey results from the [[Initiative on Global Markets Forum]] through October 30, 2012.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1257/aer.103.3.629| issn = 0002-8282| volume = 103| issue = 3| pages = 629–635| last1 = Gordon| first1 = Roger| last2 = Dahl| first2 = Gordon B| title = Views among Economists: Professional Consensus or Point-Counterpoint?| journal = American Economic Review| accessdate = 2016-07-10| date = May 2013| url = http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~gdahl/papers/views-among-economists.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|630}} Discussing the paper, [[Stony Brook University]] economist Noah Smith concluded that "at the elite level", economics "isn't divided into two warring ideological camps".<ref name=smith_warring />


[[Justin Wolfers]] (2014):

{{quote|text=These data paint a picture of a professional consensus, tempered by a degree of modesty that there’s much we don’t know. Indeed, the best research into the views of economists finds that this consensus is pervasive across a range of issues. Call it the hidden consensus in economics. It’s there, but remains largely out of sight, because in a competitive political system there’s always an incentive for at least some advocates to try to portray any empirical claim as deeply contested.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/upshot/what-debate-economists-agree-the-stimulus-lifted-the-economy.html |author=Justin Wolfers |date=July 29, 2014 |title=What Debate?

[[Bryan Caplan]]:

{{quote|text=the best survey data indicate that economists converge on a long list of unpopular positions. Compared to the general public, economists think that markets work very well, that economic interaction with foreigners makes us better off, that saving labor is a good idea, and that the economy is doing well and getting better.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2007/05/economists-agree/ |archivedate=September 12, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912145319/http://blogs.britannica.com/2007/05/economists-agree/ |date=May 8, 2007 |author=Bryan Caplan |title=Economists Agree?! |publisher=Britannica Blog |accessdate=July 9, 2016}}</ref>}}

Caplan elaborates on this in his 2007 book ''[[The Myth of the Rational Voter]]''.

==Examples of consensus among economists==

The following list presents some of the claims that have broad consensus among economists (even though they are controversial among noneconomists).

* "Societies benefit most from [[free trade]]."<ref name=yamane /><ref name=ceepreface /><ref name=griswold_cato>{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/blog/super-majority-economists-agree-trade-barriers-should-go |author=Daniel Griswold |date=September 18, 2009 |title=A Super-Majority of Economists Agree: Trade Barriers Should Go |publisher=[[Cato Institute]] |accessdate=July 10, 2016}}</ref>
* A "minimum wage increases unemployment among young and unskilled workers".<ref name=ceepreface />
* "Whereas 93% of economists reckoned a [[carbon tax]] is a less costly way to cut emissions than car fuel-mileage standards, only 23% of the public agreed."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21569378-if-economists-agree-something-public-will-almost-certainly-think |date=January 12, 2013 |title=Room with a view |publisher=The Economist |accessdate=July 9, 2016}}</ref>

* The US government should eliminate or reduce subsidies for [[ethanol]].<ref name=griswold_cato />

==Reasons for disagreement among noneconomists==

This section discusses both the reasons for disagreement among noneconomists as well as reasons for the noneconomists' impression that economists disagree when there is in fact a consensus.

{{quote|text=So why do pundits and voters lag economists in supporting free trade? In his excellent book [[The Myth of the Rational Voter]], Bryan Caplan provides evidence that people suffer from a handful of systematic biases that influence their beliefs, and three of these can help explain why voters are skeptical of trade: anti-market bias, anti-foreign bias, and pessimism bias.

[[Paul Krugman]] provides three reasons why intellectuals in particular resist the theory of comparative advantage that underpins free trade: 1) opposition to free trade is intellectually fashionable, 2) comparative advantage is hard to understand, and 3) they are averse to a fundamentally mathematical understanding of the world.<ref name=atlantic_ozimek />}}

The [[Bentley University]] economist [[Scott Sumner]], writing for his blog ''[[TheMoneyIllusion]]'', argued that noneconomists have "utter disdain" for economists' views on [[microeconomics]] because they have "made up their minds" using "common sense".<ref name=sumner_astro>{{cite web |url=http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=18673 |date=January 16, 2013 |website=TheMoneyIllusion |title=The public wants us to be astrologers or heretics, not scientists |accessdate=July 9, 2016 |author=Scott Sumner}}</ref>

A piece in ''[[The Economist]]'' notes that the public has low trust for economists and for the government to execute on policy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/01/economists |title=Trust us |publisher=The Economist |accessdate=July 9, 2016 |date=January 11, 2013}}</ref>

[[Noah Smith]], an economist at [[Stony Brook University]], recalls the history of economics as "a literary enterprise, advanced by philosophical treatises rather than laboratory experiments", which could lower the public's trust of economics. Further, he argues that in the case of noneconomists' opposition to the economists' consensus on free trade, noneconomists may be using a [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] intuition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/why-do-people-think-economists-are.html |author=Noah Smith |date=January 10, 2013 |title=Why do people think economists are charlatans? |accessdate=July 9, 2016 |website=Noahpinion}}</ref>

David R. Henderson argues that journalism tries to present both sides of an issue in a "balanced" way even when there is professional consensus, and that noneconomists might be confusing [[Positive statement|positive analysis]] and [[normative]] analysis (see [[is–ought problem]]).<ref name=ceepreface />

In the survey responses of Kearl et al., "[economic] journalism was described as inaccurate, biased, distorted, sensationalized, and unsophisticated".<ref name=kearl_1979 />{{rp|29}} Moreover, the public and journalists tend to focus most on issues that economists disagree on most (i.e. macroeconomic policy questions that frequently involve forecasting and normative statements).<ref name=kearl_1979 />{{rp|36}}
