The '''professional consensus of economics''' refers to the phenomenon of convergence of views of economists on issues that are contentious among noneconomists. The convergence of views happens mainly in [[microeconomics]]; in [[macroeconomics]] professional opinion can be divided.<ref name=ceepreface /><ref name=sumner_astro /><ref name=taylor_praxtime /><ref name=kearl_1979 />{{rp|33}}

==History==

In 1979, [[James R. Kearl]], [[Clayne L. Pope]], [[Gordon C. Whiting]], and [[Larry T. Wimmer]] published "A Confusion of Economists?"<ref name="klein_2007">{{Cite journal| volume = 66| issue = 2| pages = 309–334| last1 = Klein| first1 = Daniel B.| last2 = Stern| first2 = Charlotta| title = Is There a Free-Market Economist in the House?

Writing in 1992, the [[Pitzer College]] economist [[Linus Yamane]] said that "the most common complaint" of economists by noneconomists is that they "never agree", but then points out that "[on] many issues economists are quite unanimous in their opinion". Nevertheless, Yamane argues that this consensus is ignored and that "politics always dominates economics".<ref name="yamane">{{cite web |url=http://bernard.pitzer.edu/~lyamane/fun.htm |author=Linus Yamane  |title=Why do people make fun of economists? |accessdate=July 9, 2016 |date=February 1992}}</ref>

In 1993, economist [[David R. Henderson]] noted in the preface to ''[[The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics]]'' the popular perception that "economists never agree", but countered by saying "[while] economists disagree on many matters, they have reached virtually unanimous agreement on a multitude of others".<ref name=ceepreface>{{cite web |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/bios/CEEPreface.html |editor=David R.

In 2006, economist [[Robert Whaples]] surveyed 210 PhD economists from the [[American Economic Association]] (84 of whom responded) and found that economists favored free trade, expansion of competition, and so forth.<ref name=whaples_2006>{{Cite journal| volume = 3| issue = 9| last = Whaples| first = Robert| title = Do economists agree on anything?

Writing in 2007, [[Daniel B. Klein]] and [[Charlotta Stern]] argued that "economists oppose protectionism, but otherwise there has been no sign of any preponderant support for free-market principles. Indeed, many questions that have been repeated through time have consistently shown the majority of economists to be friendly to numerous government interventions." The authors also suggest that previous surveys may overstate consensus because the questions were framed narrowly (rather than asking for an overall judgment).<ref name=klein_2007 />{{rp|312–313}}

[[George Mason University]] economist [[Bryan Caplan]] wrote in 2007 that "the best survey data indicate that economists converge on a long list of unpopular positions. Compared to the general public, economists think that markets work very well, that economic interaction with foreigners makes us better off, that saving labor is a good idea, and that the economy is doing well and getting better."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2007/05/economists-agree/ |archivedate=September 12, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912145319/http://blogs.britannica.com/2007/05/economists-agree/ |date=May 8, 2007 |author=Bryan Caplan |title=Economists Agree?! |publisher=Britannica Blog |accessdate=July 9, 2016}}</ref> Caplan elaborates on this in his 2007 book ''[[The Myth of the Rational Voter]]''.<ref name=atlantic_ozimek />

[[Harvard University]] macroeconomist [[Greg Mankiw]] noted the consensus among economists in 2006<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/11/consensus-of-economists.html |date=November 30, 2006 |author=Greg Mankiw |website=Greg Mankiw's Blog |title=The Consensus of Economists |accessdate=July 9, 2016}}</ref> and again in 2009<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2009/02/news-flash-economists-agree.html |date=February 14, 2009 |author=Greg Mankiw |title=News Flash: Economists Agree |website=Greg Mankiw's Blog |accessdate=July 9, 2016}}</ref> on his blog.

In 2012, [[University of Chicago]] economist [[Steven Levitt]] shared the [[Initiative on Global Markets Forum]] survey results available at the time (which show broad agreement among economists), and added that in his experience, "[most] economists think very much alike."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://freakonomics.com/2012/01/09/if-all-the-economists-were-laid-end-to-end-would-they-reach-a-conclusion/ |author=by Steven D.

In 2012, [[Justin Wolfers]] noted that there is "remarkable agreement among economists on most policy questions".<ref name=wolfers_freak_2012>{{cite web |url=http://freakonomics.com/2012/07/25/the-secret-consensus-among-economists/ |author=by Justin Wolfers |date=July 25, 2012 |title=The Secret Consensus Among Economists |publisher=Freakonomics |accessdate=July 9, 2016}}</ref> Wolfers noted the professional consensus again in 2014, calling it "the hidden consensus in economics".<ref name=wolfers_nyt_2014>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/upshot/what-debate-economists-agree-the-stimulus-lifted-the-economy.html |author=Justin Wolfers |date=July 29, 2014 |title=What Debate?

In 2013, [[Roger H. Gordon]] and [[Gordon B. Dahl]] published the paper "Views among Economists: Professional Consensus or Point-Counterpoint?" using survey results from the [[Initiative on Global Markets Forum]] through October 30, 2012.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1257/aer.103.3.629| issn = 0002-8282| volume = 103| issue = 3| pages = 629–635| last1 = Gordon| first1 = Roger| last2 = Dahl| first2 = Gordon B| title = Views among Economists: Professional Consensus or Point-Counterpoint?| journal = American Economic Review| accessdate = 2016-07-10| date = May 2013| url = http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~gdahl/papers/views-among-economists.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|630}} Discussing the paper, [[Stony Brook University]] economist Noah Smith concluded that "at the elite level", economics "isn't divided into two warring ideological camps".<ref name=smith_warring />

==Reasons for disagreement among noneconomists==

This section discusses both the reasons for disagreement among noneconomists as well as reasons for the noneconomists' impression that economists disagree when there is in fact a consensus.

Bryan Caplan has argued in ''[[The Myth of the Rational Voter]]'' that noneconomists "suffer from a [[The Myth of the Rational Voter#Summary|handful of systematic biases]] that influence their beliefs".<ref name=atlantic_ozimek>{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/04/4-politically-controversial-issues-where-all-economists-agree/255600/ |author=Adam Ozimek |date=April 9, 2012 |title=4 Politically Controversial Issues Where All Economists Agree |publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]'' |accessdate=July 9, 2016}}</ref>

[[Paul Krugman]] has argued that noneconomist intellectuals "resist the theory of comparative advantage that underpins free trade" because it is intellectually fashionable, comparative advantage is difficult to understand, and they are averse to a mathematical understanding of the world.<ref name=atlantic_ozimek />

The [[Bentley University]] economist [[Scott Sumner]], writing for his blog ''[[TheMoneyIllusion]]'', argued that noneconomists have "utter disdain" for economists' views on [[microeconomics]] because they have "made up their minds" using "common sense".<ref name=sumner_astro>{{cite web |url=http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=18673 |date=January 16, 2013 |website=TheMoneyIllusion |title=The public wants us to be astrologers or heretics, not scientists |accessdate=July 9, 2016 |author=Scott Sumner}}</ref>

A piece in ''[[The Economist]]'' notes that the public has low trust for economists and for the government to execute on policy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/01/economists |title=Trust us |publisher=The Economist |accessdate=July 9, 2016 |date=January 11, 2013}}</ref>

[[Noah Smith]], an economist at [[Stony Brook University]], recalls the history of economics as "a literary enterprise, advanced by philosophical treatises rather than laboratory experiments", which could lower the public's trust of economics. Further, he argues that in the case of noneconomists' opposition to the economists' consensus on free trade, noneconomists may be using a [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] intuition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/why-do-people-think-economists-are.html |author=Noah Smith |date=January 10, 2013 |title=Why do people think economists are charlatans? |accessdate=July 9, 2016 |website=Noahpinion}}</ref>

David R. Henderson argues that journalism tries to present both sides of an issue in a "balanced" way even when there is professional consensus, and that noneconomists might be confusing [[Positive statement|positive analysis]] and [[normative]] analysis (see [[is–ought problem]]).<ref name=ceepreface />

In the survey responses of Kearl et al., "[economic] journalism was described as inaccurate, biased, distorted, sensationalized, and unsophisticated".<ref name=kearl_1979 />{{rp|29}} Moreover, the public and journalists tend to focus most on issues that economists disagree on most (i.e. macroeconomic policy questions that frequently involve forecasting and normative statements).<ref name=kearl_1979 />{{rp|36}}

Justin Wolfers argued that professional consensus "remains largely out of sight, because in a competitive political system there's always an incentive for at least some advocates to try to portray any empirical claim as deeply contested."<ref name=wolfers_nyt_2014 />
