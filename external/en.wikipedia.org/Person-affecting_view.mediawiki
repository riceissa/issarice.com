A '''person-affecting''' or '''person-based view''' in [[population ethics]] captures the intuition that an act can only be bad if it is bad ''for'' someone. Similarly something can be good only if it is good ''for'' someone. Therefore according to standard person-affecting views, there is no moral obligation nor moral good to create people because nonexistence means "there is never a person who could have benefited from being created". Whether one accepts person-affecting views greatly influences to what extent shaping the far future is important.<ref name="beckstead-thesis">Beckstead, Nick.
