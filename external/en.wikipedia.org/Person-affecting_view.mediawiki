A '''person-affecting''' or '''person-based view''' (also called '''person-affecting restriction'''<ref name="arrhenius-2003">Gustaf Arrhenius. "The Person-Affecting Restriction, Comparativism, and the Moral Status of Potential People". 2003. http://www.iffs.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/The-Person-Affecting-Restriction-Comparativism-and-the-Moral-Status-of-Potential-People.pdf</ref>) in [[population ethics]] captures the intuition that an act can only be bad if it is bad ''for'' someone. Similarly something can be good only if it is good ''for'' someone. Therefore according to standard person-affecting views, there is no moral obligation to create people nor moral good in creating people because nonexistence means "there is never a person who could have benefited from being created". Whether one accepts person-affecting views greatly influences to what extent shaping the far future is important.<ref name="beckstead-thesis">Beckstead, Nick. ''On the Overwhelming Importance of Shaping the Far Future''. 2013. PhD Thesis. Department of Philosophy, Rutgers University.</ref>

A weaker form of person-affecting views states that an act can only be bad if it is bad for some existing or future person.

Some philosophers who have discussed person-affecting views include [[Derek Parfit]], Gustaf Arrhenius, Nick Beckstead, and Hilary Greaves.

==Variations==

There is no single "person-affecting view" but rather a variety of formulations all involving the idea of something being good or bad ''for'' someone.

* Gustaf Arrhenius formulates the "person-affecting restriction" as saying that moral claims "necessarily involve a reference to humans", so that statements only referencing "the scenery" or the balance of the ecosystem (without reference to humans) are excluded from moral consideration.<ref name="arrhenius-2003"/>
