'''Form 990''' (officially, "Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax"<ref name="actual_990">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f990.pdf |title=Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax |accessdate=January 28, 2016 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}</ref>) provides the public with financial information about a nonprofit organization, and is often the only source of such information.  It is also used by government agencies to prevent organizations from abusing their tax-exempt status. In June 2007, the IRS released a new Form 990 that requires significant disclosures on [[corporate governance]] and boards of directors. These new disclosures are required for all nonprofit filers for the 2009 tax year, with more significant reporting requirements for nonprofits with over $1 million in revenues or $2.5 million in assets. In addition, certain nonprofits have more comprehensive reporting requirements, such as hospitals and other health care organizations (Schedule H).

The Form 990 disclosures do not require but strongly encourage nonprofit boards to adopt a variety of board policies regarding governance practices. These suggestions go beyond [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] requirements for nonprofits to adopt [[whistleblower]] and document retention policies. The IRS has indicated they will use the Form 990 as an enforcement tool, particularly regarding executive compensation. For example, nonprofits that adopt specific procedures regarding executive compensation are offered [[safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] from excessive compensation rules under section 4958 of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulation section 53.4958-6.<ref>{{cite web|last=IRS |url=http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/governance_practices.pdf |title=Governance and Related Topics - 501(c)(3) Organizations |publisher=Online.irs.gov |date=2008-02-04 |accessdate=2009-06-05}}</ref>

In addition to Form 990, tax-exempt organizations are also subject to a variety of disclosure and compliance requirements through various schedules which are attached to Form 990 (and, in some cases, 990-EZ or 990-PF). Filing of schedules by organizations supplements, enhances, and further clarifies disclosures and compliance reporting made in Form 990. Often, filing of schedules is mandatory, but there are situations where organizations not otherwise subject to filing requirements may consider completing certain schedules despite not being technically obligated to. The current{{When|reason=as of when? This parargraph has no citations so no one knows if this list is accurate|date=December 2015}} list of possible schedule filings are:
* Schedule A - Public Charity Status and Public Support
