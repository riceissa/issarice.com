[[File:IRS_Form_990.pdf|thumb|right|Form 990, 2015]]

'''Form 990''' (officially, the "Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax"<ref name="actual_990">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f990.pdf |title=Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax |accessdate=January 28, 2016 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}</ref>) provides the public with financial information about a nonprofit organization, and is often the only source of such information.  It is also used by government agencies to prevent organizations from abusing their tax-exempt status. Certain nonprofits have more comprehensive reporting requirements, such as hospitals and other health care organizations (Schedule H).

==Variants==

===Form 990-EZ===

There is a variant of Form 990 called '''Form 990-EZ''' ("Short Form Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax"). This form can be used instead of Form 990 for organizations with gross receipts less than $200,000 and total assets less than $500,000 (there are some exceptions).<ref name="i990ez">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i990ez.pdf |title=Instructions for Form 990-EZ |accessdate=February 3, 2016 |date=2015 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}</ref>

===Form 990-N===

Small organizations whose annual gross receipts are "normally $50,000 or less" must file the electronic '''Form 990-N''' (officially, "Electronic Notice (e-Postcard) for Tax-Exempt Organizations Not Required to File Form 990 or Form 990EZ"). There is no paper form for 990-N, but it is possible to file instead Form 990 or Form 990-EZ.<ref name="epost_irs">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/Charities-%26-Non-Profits/Annual-Electronic-Filing-Requirement-for-Small-Exempt-Organizations-Form-990-N-e-Postcard |title=Annual Electronic Filing Requirement for Small Exempt Organizations — Form 990-N (e-Postcard) |accessdate=February 2, 2016 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}</ref>

===Form 990-PF===

'''Form 990-PF''' is filed by private foundations in the US. It includes fiscal information and a complete list of grants, among other information. The form is due to the IRS 4.5 months after the end of the foundation's [[fiscal year]].<ref name="foundationcenter">{{cite web |url=http://foundationcenter.org/getstarted/tutorials/demystify/ |title=Demystifying the 990-PF |accessdate=February 3, 2016 |publisher=Foundation Center}}</ref>

==Schedules==

In addition to Form 990, tax-exempt organizations are also subject to a variety of disclosure and compliance requirements through various schedules which are attached to Form 990 (and, in some cases, 990-EZ or 990-PF). Filing of schedules by organizations supplements, enhances, and further clarifies disclosures and compliance reporting made in Form 990. Often, filing of schedules is mandatory, but there are situations where organizations not otherwise subject to filing requirements may consider completing certain schedules despite not being technically obligated to.

==Filing requirements==

Form 990 is due on the 15th of the 5th month after the fiscal year, with up to 6 months of extensions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irs.gov/Charities-%26-Non-Profits/Annual-Exempt-Organization-Return:-Due-Date |title=Annual exempt organization return: Due date |publisher=IRS |accessdate=2014-05-17}}</ref>

The Form 990 disclosures do not require but strongly encourage nonprofit boards to adopt a variety of board policies regarding governance practices. These suggestions go beyond [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] requirements for nonprofits to adopt [[whistleblower]] and document retention policies. The IRS has indicated they will use the Form 990 as an enforcement tool, particularly regarding executive compensation. For example, nonprofits that adopt specific procedures regarding executive compensation are offered [[safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] from excessive compensation rules under section 4958 of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulation section 53.4958-6.<ref>{{cite web|last=IRS |url=http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/governance_practices.pdf |title=Governance and Related Topics - 501(c)(3) Organizations |publisher=Online.irs.gov |date=2008-02-04 |accessdate=2009-06-05}}</ref>

===Fiduciary reporting===

According to section 1223(b) of the [[Pension Protection Act of 2006]], a nonprofit organization that does not file annual returns or notices for three consecutive years will have its tax-exempt status revoked as of the due date of the third return or notice.<ref>{{cite web |title= Pension Protection Act of 2006, Section 1223(b) |date= August 17, 2006 |work= Government Printing Office |url= http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-109publ280/html/PLAW-109publ280.htm }}</ref> An organization's tax-exempt status may be reinstated if it can show reasonable cause for the years of nonfiling.<ref>{{cite web |title= Notice 2011-43: Transitional Relief Under Internal Revenue Code § 6033(j) for Small Organizations |work= Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2011-25 |publisher= Internal Revenue Service |date= June 20, 2011 |url= http://www.irs.gov/irb/2011-25_IRB/ar09.html }}</ref>

===Who must file?===

Form 990 is to be filed by tax-exempt organizations under section 501(a). This includes organizations in section 501(c)(3) (excluding private foundations) and most organizations in other subsections of 501(c).<ref name="i990">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i990.pdf |title=Instructions for Form 990 Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax |accessdate=February 3, 2016 |date=2015 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}</ref> Tax-exempt organizations with annual gross receipts of $200,000 or more or assets of $500,000 or more must file Form 990.<ref name="allison">Grace Allison.

===Filing modalities===

The Form 990 may be filed with the IRS by mail or electronically with an Authorized [[IRS e-file]] Provider.

==Penalties==

There is a penalty of $20 per day until the form is filed (capped at the minimum of $1000 and 5% of the gross receipts of the organization for that year). If the gross receipts are more than $1 million, the penalty is increased to $100 per day (capped at $50,000). The penalty for failure to provide to the public is $20 per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irs.gov/Charities-%26-Non-Profits/Political-Organizations/Political-Organization-Filing-Requirements:-Penalties-for-Failing-to-Make-Forms-990-Publicly-Available |title=Penalties for Failing to Make Forms 990 Publicly Available |publisher=IRS |accessdate=2014-05-17}}</ref> There are other penalties for e.g. omitting information.<ref name="eotopicg02" />{{rp|229}}

In 1998, over $10 million was collected by the IRS for penalties on over 9000 forms.<ref name="eotopicg02" />{{rp|229}}

==History==

Form 990 was first used for the [[tax year]] ending in 1941. It started out as a two-page form.<ref name="eotopicg02" />

The form reached four pages (including instructions) in 1947. In 1976 this was increased to 5.5 pages (including instructions), with 8 pages for Schedule A. By 2000 this was 6 pages for Form 990, 42 pages for instructions, 6 pages for Schedule A, and at least 2 pages for Schedule B. This increase is due to use of a larger font and inclusion of sections that are only required for some organizations.<ref name="eotopicg02" />

Starting in 2000, political organizations were required to file Form 990.<ref name="eotopicg02" />

In June 2007, the IRS released a new Form 990 that requires significant disclosures on [[corporate governance]] and boards of directors. These new disclosures are required for all nonprofit filers for the 2009 tax year, with more significant reporting requirements for nonprofits with over $1 million in revenues or $2.5 million in assets.

In 2010, the minimum threshold of when an organization is required to file Form 990 was increased: the minimum annual gross receipts was increased from $100,000 to $200,000 and the minimum assets was increased from $250,000 to $500,000.<ref name="allison"/>

With the availability of the internet, access to the Form 990 of an organization has also become easier. Originally Form 990 had to be requested through the IRS. This was changed to allow access to the form directly through the organization, although in some cases organizations refused to provide access.<ref name="eotopicg02">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/eotopicg02.pdf |title=G.

==Use by charity evaluation organizations==

[[Charity Navigator]] uses IRS Forms 990<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/content.view/cpid/484.htm#10 |title=FAQ for Donors |publisher=Charity Navigator |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref> to rate charities.

Meanwhile [[Holden Karnofsky]] of the nonprofit charity evaluator [[GiveWell]] has criticized Form 990 for not providing sufficient information about what a charity does or where it operates.<ref name="dont_talk_to_me">{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2007/05/23/dont-talk-to-me-about-the-form-990/ |title=Don’t talk to me about the Form 990 |accessdate=January 28, 2016 |date=May 23, 2007 |last=Karnofsky |first=Holden |publisher=The GiveWell Blog}}</ref> However GiveWell does still use Form 990 to answer some questions when investigating charities.<ref name="guide_to_gw_fin_met">{{cite web |url=http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/criteria/financial-metrics |title=Guide to GiveWell's financial metrics |accessdate=January 28, 2016 |publisher=GiveWell}}</ref>

There was a website called ''Quality 990'' that advocated for higher quality Form 990s.<ref name="q990">{{cite web |url=http://www.qual990.org/background.html |title=Background for Quality 990 Efforts |accessdate=January 29, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515232901/http://www.qual990.org/background.html |archivedate=May 15, 2008}}</ref>
