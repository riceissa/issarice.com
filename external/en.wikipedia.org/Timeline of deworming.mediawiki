'''Notes to include in the big picture''' (once I have a better understanding of the outline of the history):

General trend to keep in mind:

"The historical change in the prevalence of schistosomiasis has altered dramatically in more recent times with the rapid development of large-scale irrigation projects.  These projects have not only allowed a greater range of permanent habitats for the snail intermediate host, but have also caused more people to come in contact with infected water, either through greater population concentration or through greater access to water.  In addition, migration of people from infected to uninfected areas has accentuated the increase in schistosomiasis."<ref name=sandbach/>{{rp|262}}

More specifically:

"It is now generally agreed that there has been a rapid increase in the world prevalence of the disease, especially since the Second World War, and it has increased in many areas despite the implementation of costly control programmes."<ref name=sandbach/>{{rp|262}}

"During the ensuing post-World War period the World Health Organization has been the principal body concerned with the international support of research and control programmes" of schistosomiasis.{{rp|266}}
