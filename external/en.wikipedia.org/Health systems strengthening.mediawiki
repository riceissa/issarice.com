"Often, however, health system strengthening seems a distant, even abstract aim."<ref>http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44204/1/9789241563895_eng.pdf</ref>

ok.

"Strengthening a health system means initiating activities in the six
internationally accepted core HSS functions â€“ human resources for health;
health finance; health governance; health information; medical products,
vaccines, and technologies; and service delivery."<ref name=usaid/>

"Despite this new attention upon HSS, the term remains a vague concept, with varying definitions and strategies for HSS, and varying ideas about the role attributed to the health system in improving public health. In this Policy Forum, we argue that most current HSS strategies are selective (i.e., they target a specific disease), and their effects may undermine progress towards the long-term goal of effective, high-quality, and inclusive health systems."<ref name="marchal">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000059#s2</ref><ref>http://karengrepin.com/2009/04/are-health-system-strengthening-efforts.html</ref>

"Almost any support to health interventions can be considered HSS"<ref>http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTHSD/Resources/376278-1114111154043/1011834-1246449110524/062509BermanUnpackingHealthSystemStrengthening.pdf</ref>

There has been some effort to use a [[systems thinking]] approach to health systems strengthening.<ref>https://www.hfgproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/New-Perspectives-in-Health-Systems-Strengthening-Executive-Summary.pdf</ref><ref>http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44204/1/9789241563895_eng.pdf</ref>
