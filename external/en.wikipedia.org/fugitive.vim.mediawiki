'''fugitive.vim''', also called '''vim-fugitive''' or just '''fugitive''', is a [[Git]] wrapper written for the [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] text editor by Tim Pope.<ref name="github_repo">{{cite web |url=https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive |title=fugitive.vim |accessdate=February 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_1cnCgAAQBAJ&pg=PR27&dq=fugitive.vim&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwig4LyIjIDSAhUSzWMKHSPZCgkQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&q=fugitive.vim&f=false |title=Pro Vim |first=Mark |last=McDonnell |publisher=[[Apress]] |year=2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGInCgAAQBAJ&pg=PR15&dq=fugitive.vim&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwig4LyIjIDSAhUSzWMKHSPZCgkQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&q=fugitive.vim&f=false |first=Mark |last=McDonnell |title=tmux Taster |publisher=[[Apress]] |year=2014}}</ref>

From ''Practical Vim'': "Tim Pope's rails.vim plugin was instrumental in convincing me to take Vim seriously, and many of his other plugins have become essential parts of my setup." Mentions fugitive in passing.

It is included in "plugin bundles" like spf13<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vim.spf13.com/ |first=Steve |last=Francia |title=spf13-vim - The Ultimate Vim Distribution |accessdate=February 8, 2017}}</ref> and Janus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/carlhuda/janus |accessdate=February 8, 2017 |title=Janus: Vim Distribution}}</ref>

==Name==

As with other Tim Pope plugins, the name of the plugin obliquely refers to its functionality. "fugitive.vim" contains the [[substring]] "git", as it is a [[Git]] wrapper. Tim Pope later wrote rhubarb.vim, which contains the substring "hub" in its name, as it provides the <code>:Gbrowse</code> command to work with [[GitHub]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://github.com/tpope/vim-rhubarb |title=rhubarb.vim |accessdate=February 9, 2016}}</ref>
