'''fugitive.vim''', also called '''vim-fugitive''' or just '''fugitive''', is a [[Git]] [[Wrapper function|wrapper]] written as a [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] for the [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] text editor. It was originally developed by Tim Pope, who still maintains the plugin.<ref>{{cite book |title=Practical Vim |first=Drew |last=Neil |page=273 |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-68050-127-8 |publisher=The Pragmatic Programmers |edition=2nd}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_1cnCgAAQBAJ&pg=PR27&dq=fugitive.vim&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwig4LyIjIDSAhUSzWMKHSPZCgkQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&q=fugitive.vim&f=false |title=Pro Vim |first=Mark |last=McDonnell |publisher=[[Apress]] |year=2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGInCgAAQBAJ&pg=PR15&dq=fugitive.vim&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwig4LyIjIDSAhUSzWMKHSPZCgkQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&q=fugitive.vim&f=false |first=Mark |last=McDonnell |title=tmux Taster |publisher=[[Apress]] |year=2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://realpython.com/blog/python/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/ |title=VIM and Python - a match made in heaven|publisher=Real Python |accessdate=February 9, 2017 |date=October 27, 2015}}</ref>

==Name==

As with other Tim Pope plugins, the name of the plugin obliquely refers to its functionality. "fugitive.vim" contains the [[substring]] "git", as it is a [[Git]] wrapper.
