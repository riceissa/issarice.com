From ''Practical Vim'': "Tim Pope's rails.vim plugin was instrumental in convincing me to take Vim seriously, and many of his other plugins have become essential parts of my setup." Mentions fugitive in passing.

One of the few Vim plugins to have its own package on Ubuntu.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?suite=default&section=all&arch=any&keywords=vim-&searchon=names |title=Package Search Results for 'vim-'}}</ref>
