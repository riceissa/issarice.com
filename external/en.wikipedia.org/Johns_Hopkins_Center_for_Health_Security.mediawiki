It is a [[think tank]] that does policy research and gives policy recommendations to the [[United States government]].<ref name=about>[http://www.upmchealthsecurity.org/website/about_us/ Center for Health Security] Mission Statement   {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622081819/http://www.upmchealthsecurity.org/website/about_us/ |date=June 22, 2013 }}</ref><ref name="open_phil" />

==History==

The Center for Health Security began as the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies (CCBS) in 1998 at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.<ref name="roos" /> [[D. A. Henderson]] served as the founding director.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-staff/profiles/henderson/index.html |author=UPMC Center for Health Security |date=January 18, 2017 |title=D. A. Henderson |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |quote=He was Dean Emeritus and Professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and a Founding Director (1998) of the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies.}}</ref> At that time, the Center was the first and only academic center focused on biosecurity policy and practice.

At one point around 2003, CHS had become part of a new [[umbrella organization]] called the Institute for Global Health and Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.<ref name="roos" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://pages.jh.edu/~gazette/2003/22sep03/22global.html |title=Public Health forms Global Health, Security Institute |publisher=''Johns Hopkins Gazette'' |date=September 22, 2003 |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |first=Tim |last=Parsons}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2003/global-health-security.html |author=JH Bloomberg School of Public Health |date=September 16, 2003 |title=Institute for Global Health and Security |publisher=Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health |accessdate=February 10, 2017}}</ref>

In November 2003, the leaders left Johns Hopkins to join the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] (UPMC), and relaunched the Center as the Center for Biosecurity of UPMC. This move apparently split the organization in two, and it is unclear what happened to the old organization.<ref name="roos">{{cite web |url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2003/09/johns-hopkins-biodefense-experts-head-new-direction |first=Robert |last=Roos|publisher=CIDRAP |title=Johns Hopkins biodefense experts head in new direction |accessdate=February 8, 2017 |date=September 23, 2003 |quote=the four full-time faculty members and 16 administrative staff members of the CCBS are all leaving Hopkins to join the UPMC. 'No decision has been made exactly what to do with the Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies, whether it'll have a new direction or mission incorporated into some other center,' [Tim Parsons] said. 'But its biodefense activities will be incorporated in some way into the new initiative of the Institute for Global Health Security.'}}</ref>

On April 30, 2013, the Center changed its name from "Center for Biosecurity of UPMC" to "UPMC Center for Health Security". This name change reflected a broadening of the scope of CHS's work.

In January 2017, the Center became part of the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]]. Its [[domain name]] changed from upmchealthsecurity.org to centerforhealthsecurity.org.<ref name="jh_rename" />

==Funding==

In 2002, the Center received a $1 million grant from the US federal government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2002/biodefense-grant.html |date=January 7, 2002 |title=Biodefense Center to Receive $1 Million |author=JH Bloomberg School of Public Health |publisher=Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health |accessdate=February 10, 2017}}</ref>

Before 2017, CHS was heavily reliant on government funding.<ref name="open_phil" />

In January 2017, the [[Open Philanthropy Project]] awarded a $16 million grant over three years to the Center for Health Security.<ref name="open_phil">{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/biosecurity/center-health-security-biosecurity-global-health-security-and-global-catastrophic |title=Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security — Biosecurity, Global Health Security, and Global Catastrophic Risks |publisher= Open Philanthropy Project |accessdate=February 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thedailyrecord.com/2017/02/08/maryland-health-security-grant-hopkins/ |title=Hopkins' Center for Health Security gets $16M grant |publisher=Maryland Daily Record |author=Associated Press |date=February 8, 2017 |accessdate=February 8, 2017 |quote=The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's Center for Health Security has been awarded a three-year, $16 million grant to support work on strengthening health security and public health preparedness.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/8/center-for-health-security-gets-16m-grant/ |publisher=''[[The Washington Times]]'' |title=Center for Health Security gets $16M grant |date=February 8, 2017 |accessdate=February 8, 2017}}</ref>
