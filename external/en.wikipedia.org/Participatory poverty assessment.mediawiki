'''Participatory poverty assessment''' (PPA) is the approach to analyzing and reducing poverty by incorporating the views of the poor. PPAs attempt to better understand the poor, to give the poor more influence over decisions that affect their lives, and to increase effectiveness of poverty reduction policies.<ref name="ppa_guide">{{cite web |url=http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/238411/ppa.pdf |title=A rough guide to PPAs |author=Andy Norton with Bella Bird Karen Brock Margaret Kakande Carrie Turk |publisher=Overseas Development Institute |year=2006}}</ref>{{rp|6}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hakikazi.org/tcdd/newpage7.htm |title=Presentation on Introduction to Participatory Poverty Assessments (PPAs) |publisher=Hakikazi Catalyst |accessdate=May 10, 2016}}</ref> PPAs are seen as complements to traditional household surveys by helping to interpret survey results, and aim to capture the experiences of the poor by being more open-ended.<ref name=robb/>{{rp|xiii,xv}}

==History==

In the 1980s, "project-based" activities were dominant. Before this, there were also household-survey approaches. This shifted to participatory activities in the 1990s after critiques of these traditional methods of measuring poverty.<ref name="mcgee">McGee, Rosemary, ed. ''Knowing Poverty''. London, GB: Routledge, 2012. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 11 May 2016.</ref>{{rp|1,3}}

The term "participatory poverty assessment" was coined within the [[World Bank]] in 1992,<ref name=ppa_guide/> and was seen as a participatory form of poverty assessments (PAs).<ref name=mcgee/>{{rp|2}}

Early experiences of PPAs were in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] in the early 1990s.<ref name=mcgee/>{{rp|3}}

By 1999, 43 PPAs had been conducted: 28 in Africa, 6 in Latin America, 5 in Eastern Europe, and 4 in Asia.<ref name=robb/>{{rp|xiii,xiv}}

Early PPAs focused most on making higher quality information available to policy makers, rather than seeing the poor as itself being involved in the process of reducing poverty.<ref name=mcgee/>{{rp|3}}

Later in the 1990s, "second generation" PPAs appeared, which tried to allow the poor to influence policy decisions.<ref name=mcgee/>{{rp|4}}

As of 2012, the [[World Bank]]'s [[Voices of the Poor]] is the largest PPA ever to have been conducted.<ref name=mcgee/>{{rp|4}}

{{quote |text=PPAs devel- oped in response to the broadening thinking on the multidimensional character of poverty associated with such publications as the Bulletin on Vulnerability (Institute of Development Studies 1989) and Putting the Last First (Chambers 1983).  In the Bank, there was also ongoing project (as opposed to policy) work on understanding poverty and well-being through beneficiary assessments, participatory rural appraisals, devel- opmental anthropology approaches, and similar methods.<ref name=robb/>{{rp|3}}}}

==Types of activities==

Both PPAs and traditional surveys contain both quantitative and qualitative information, as well as "subjective" and "objective" parts, so this is not necessarily a distinguishing feature of PPAs.<ref name=robb/>{{rp|3}}

==Organizations using this approach==

* [[World Bank]]
* [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP)<ref name=robb/>{{rp|3}}

==Results==

Participatory poverty assessments confirmed the multidimensional nature of poverty (i.e. that the poor deal with lack of resources, poor health, physical violence, social isolation, etc.) that was seen from traditional household questionnaire-based methods.<ref name="robb">{{cite web |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/07/22/000094946_99040105542482/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf |title=Can the Poor Influence Policy? Participatory Poverty Assessments in the Developing World |author=Caroline M. Robb |year=1999 |publisher=[[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]}}</ref>{{rp|vi}} PPAs have also been able to access information that was not obtained in household surveys by building trust. For instance PPAs have obtained information on sensitive topics such as [[child prostitution]], drug use, and [[domestic violence]] in relation to poverty.<ref name=robb/>{{rp|xiv}}

In [[Zambia]], PPAs discovered that the timing of school fees caused economic stress for households, so new legislation to change this timing was proposed.<ref name=robb/>{{rp|xv}}

PPAs have also informed World Bank's [[World Development Report]]s.<ref name=robb/>{{rp|vi}}
