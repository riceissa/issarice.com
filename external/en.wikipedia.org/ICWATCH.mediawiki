'''ICWATCH''' is a public database of mainly [[LinkedIn]] profiles of people in the [[United States Intelligence Community]]. The database was created by Transparency Toolkit and is hosted by [[WikiLeaks]].<ref name="mb">{{cite web |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/this-database-gathers-the-resumes-of-27000-intelligence-workers |publisher=Motherboard |title=This Database Gathers the Resumes of 27,000 Intelligence Workers |date=May 7, 2015 |publisher=Vice |author=Joseph Cox |website=Motherboard |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}</ref>

==Background==

The publication of [[global surveillance disclosures (2013â€“present)|global surveillance disclosures in 2013]] revealed [[code name]]s for surveillance projects including [[MARINA]] and [[MAINWAY]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-surveillance-architecture-includes-collection-of-revealing-internet-phone-metadata/2013/06/15/e9bf004a-d511-11e2-b05f-3ea3f0e7bb5a_story.html |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |title=U.S. surveillance architecture includes collection of revealing Internet, phone metadata |accessdate=February 26, 2017 |date=Barton Gellman |date=June 15, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130617/01163623501/why-nsa-president-bush-got-fisa-court-to-reinterpret-law-order-to-collect-tons-data.shtml |title=Why The NSA And President Bush Got The FISA Court To Reinterpret The Law In Order To Collect Tons Of Data |publisher=Techdirt |accessdate=February 26, 2017 |date=June 17, 2013 |author=Mike Masnick}}</ref> It was then discovered that the [[LinkedIn]] profiles of individuals in the intelligence community mentioned these code names as well as additional ones.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/csoghoian/status/346139237856460801 |author=Christopher Soghoian |date=June 15, 2013 |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=February 26, 2017 |title=Tweet by @csoghoian |quote=Linkedin profiles of people in Maryland that mention MARINA & NUCLEON have some fun other codenames like TRAFFICTHIEF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130617/13482623512/discovering-names-secret-nsa-surveillance-programs-via-linkedin.shtml |title=Discovering Names Of Secret NSA Surveillance Programs Via LinkedIn |publisher=Techdirt |accessdate=February 26, 2017 |date=June 18, 2013 |author=Mike Masnick}}</ref> Transparency Toolkit took advantage of this and automated the collection of LinkedIn profiles mentioning such code names, collating them into a searchable database.<ref name="mb" /><ref name="zdnet_20150506">{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/linkedin-serves-up-resumes-of-27000-us-intelligence-personnel/ |publisher=ZDNet |title=LinkedIn serves up resumes of 27,000 US intelligence personnel |author=Rob O'Neill |accessdate=February 22, 2017 |date=May 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Kalev Leetaru |url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2016/08/13/is-government-secrecy-dead-in-the-internet-and-social-media-era/ |archive-date=February 22, 2017 |archive-url=https://archive.fo/kqsCC#selection-2441.182-2447.371 |dead-url=no |publisher=Forbes |title=Is Government Secrecy Dead In The Internet And Social Media Era? |date=August 13, 2016 |accessdate=February 22, 2017 |quote=Last year the Transparency Toolkit released ICWATCH, a searchable database of more than 27,000 intelligence community employees, culled entirely from keyword searches of information IC employees uploaded themselves to LinkedIn.

==Name==

The name "ICWATCH" is a play on [[ICREACH]], an alleged [[Classified information|top-secret]] surveillance-related search engine created by the United States [[National Security Agency]] after the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name="Intercept">{{cite web | last = Gallagher | first = Ryan | title = The Surveillance Engine: How the NSA Built Its Own Secret Google | work = [[The Intercept]] | date = Aug 25, 2014 | url = https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/08/25/icreach-nsa-cia-secret-google-crisscross-proton/ }}</ref><ref name="mb" />

==History==

The initial commit to the [[Git]] repository of LookingGlass was made on August 23, 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://github.com/TransparencyToolkit/LookingGlass/commit/38d1787a21144654c9e7baf895fe34a21e992854 |date=August 23, 2014 |title=First version |author=M. C. McGrath (Shidash) |publisher=[[GitHub]]}}</ref> LookingGlass is a search tool that was built for use in ICWATCH.<ref name="zdnet_20150506" />

ICWATCH launched on May 6, 2015;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://transparencytoolkit.org/icwatch/ |title=ICWATCH |publisher=Transparency Toolkit |accessdate=February 22, 2017 |date=May 6, 2015 |author=M. C. McGrath}}</ref> on the same day, Transparency Toolkit, the group that created ICWATCH, presented it at the [[re:publica]] conference.<ref name="mb" /> At launch, the database contained information from over 27,000 LinkedIn profiles.<ref name="mb" /><ref name="pcw">{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2919975/new-database-taps-linkedin-to-watch-the-nsa-watchers.html |date=May 7, 2015 |publisher=PCWorld |title=New database taps LinkedIn to watch the NSA watchers |accessdate=February 22, 2017 |author=Ian Paul}}</ref>

By mid-May 2015, Transparency Toolkit began receiving requests from individuals to be removed from ICWATCH, including [[death threat]]s.<ref name="zdnet">{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/death-threat-fbi-complaint-greet-launch-of-intelligence-community-database/ |publisher=ZDNet |title=Death threat, FBI complaint greet launch of intelligence community database |author=Rob O'Neill |accessdate=February 22, 2017 |date=May 19, 2015}}</ref><ref name="rt">{{cite web |url=https://www.rt.com/usa/260577-wikileaks-contractor-database-transparency/ |publisher=RT International |title=WikiLeaks takes spy contractor database under its wing amid death threats |accessdate=February 22, 2017 |date=May 20, 2015}}</ref> Following the threats as well as [[distributed denial-of-service attack]]s made against the site, WikiLeaks began hosting the website and database by the end of May 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2015/5/28/the_kill_list_icwatch_uses_linkedin |title=The Kill List: ICWatch Uses LinkedIn Account Info to Out Officials Who Aided Assassination Program |publisher=''[[Democracy Now!]]'' |accessdate=February 22, 2017 |date=May 28, 2015}}</ref><ref name="zdnet" />

By May 20, 2015, the number of profiles in ICWATCH had increased to almost 140,000.<ref name="rt" />

In August 2016 [[TechCrunch]] reported that LinkedIn was suing 100 unnamed individuals who had scraped LinkedIn's website, and named ICWATCH as a possible target.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/15/linkedin-sues-scrapers/ |date=August 15, 2016 |publisher=[[TechCrunch]] |title=LinkedIn sues anonymous data scrapers |author=Kate Conger |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}</ref>

{{as of|2017|02}}, the database tracks over 100,000 profiles from LinkedIn, Indeed, and other public sources.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://transparencytoolkit.org/project/icwatch/ |title=ICWATCH |publisher=Transparency Toolkit |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}</ref>

==Features==

The database can be searched using the company, location, industry, and other parameters of the intelligence workers.<ref name="mb" />

==Findings==

Most of the discovered profiles are not of those in the [[National Security Agency]] but of those working for [[List of United States defense contractors|contractors]].<ref name="mb" />

The project also revealed possible trends in employment in the intelligence community. For instance, the "number of people claiming to work with [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]] databases [&hellip;] has increased dramatically over the years since 2008, with just a small decline starting in 2013."<ref name="mb" />

M. C. McGrath of Transparency Toolkit believes that the workers are "for the most part, pretty normal people".<ref name="mb" />

==Reception==

Ian Paul of ''[[PC World]]'' voiced concern for the safety of the individuals listed in the database.<ref name="pcw" />
