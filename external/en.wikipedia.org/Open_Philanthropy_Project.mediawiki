The '''Open Philanthropy Project''' (often abbreviated as '''Open Phil''' and formerly GiveWell Labs) is a joint project between [[GiveWell]] and [[Good Ventures]] that tries to identify the most effective ways to give money to a wide variety of causes.<ref name="openphil_formerly_gwl">{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2014/08/20/open-philanthropy-project-formerly-givewell-labs/ |title=Open Philanthropy Project (formerly GiveWell Labs) |first=Holden |last=Karnofsky |publisher=GiveWell}}</ref> As of March 2016, the organization is still not entirely separate from GiveWell.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2015/12/10/december-2015-open-thread/comment-page-1/#comment-934738 |first=Elie |last=Hassenfeld |title=Comment on December 2015 Open Thread}}</ref>

== History ==

The Open Philanthropy Project started out as GiveWell Labs in XXXX.

The name was changed to Open Philanthropy Project to separate it from GiveWell and also to avoid exclusive association to GiveWell because it is a collaboration with Good Ventures. However even after this initial brand change, updates to Open Phil were still posted to the GiveWell blog.<ref name="openphil_formerly_gwl" />

As of March 2016, the Open Philanthropy Project is not an independent organization i.e. it is still a collaboration between GiveWell and Good Ventures, who share office space and information (to an extent).<ref name="about_page">{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/good-ventures-and-givewell |title=Good Ventures &amp; GiveWell |accessdate=March 18, 2016 |publisher=Open Philanthropy Project}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2015/12/10/december-2015-open-thread/comment-page-1/#comment-934738 |first=Elie |last=Hassenfeld |title=Comment on December 2015 Open Thread}}</ref>

== Focus areas ==

The Open Philanthropy Project uses the term "cause" to describe a problem or opportunity that requires expertise in order to make good giving decisions. It uses the term "focus area" for causes with the highest level of priority.<ref name="focus_areas">{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus |title=Focus Areas |accessdate=March 18, 2016 |publisher=Open Philanthropy Project}}</ref>

The following table lists the current (as of March 2016) focus areas for each broad category of investigation.
