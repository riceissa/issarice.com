== History ==

The Open Philanthropy Project started out as GiveWell Labs in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2011/09/08/announcing-givewell-labs/ |title=Announcing GiveWell Labs |date=September 8, 2011 |accessdate=March 19, 2016 |publisher=GiveWell}}</ref>

The name was changed to Open Philanthropy Project to separate it from GiveWell and also to avoid exclusive association to GiveWell because it is a collaboration with Good Ventures. However even after this initial brand change, updates to Open Phil were still posted to the GiveWell blog.<ref name="openphil_formerly_gwl" />

In April 2015, Open Phil announced a partnership with Kaitlyn Trigger and [[Mike Krieger]] (co-founder of [[Instagram]]). Trigger and Krieger pledged $750,000 over two years while Open Phil would provide information and include Trigger in team meetings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2015/04/23/co-funding-partnership-with-kaitlyn-trigger-and-mike-krieger/ |title=Co-funding Partnership with Kaitlyn Trigger and Mike Krieger |date=April 23, 2015 |accessdate=March 19, 2016 |publisher=GiveWell |first=Holden |last=Karnofsky}}</ref><ref name="vox_matthews"/>

As of March 2016, the Open Philanthropy Project is not an independent organization i.e. it is still a collaboration between GiveWell and Good Ventures, who share office space and information (to an extent).<ref name="about_page">{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/good-ventures-and-givewell |title=Good Ventures &amp; GiveWell |accessdate=March 18, 2016 |publisher=Open Philanthropy Project}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2015/12/10/december-2015-open-thread/comment-page-1/#comment-934738 |first=Elie |last=Hassenfeld |title=Comment on December 2015 Open Thread}}</ref>

== Focus areas ==

The Open Philanthropy Project uses the term "cause" to describe a problem or opportunity that requires expertise in order to make good giving decisions. It uses the term "focus area" for causes with the highest level of priority.<ref name="focus_areas">{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus |title=Focus Areas |accessdate=March 18, 2016 |publisher=Open Philanthropy Project}}</ref>

The following table lists the current (as of March 2016) focus areas for each broad category of investigation.<ref name="focus_areas"/><ref name="open_democracy_March_20_2016c">{{cite web |url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/transformation/scott-weathers/can-effective-altruism-change-world-it-already-has |title=Can ‘effective altruism' change the world?

In a blog post in October 2015, Holden Karnofsky described reasons Open Phil isn't currently funding organizations that promote [[effective altruism]].<ref name="Effective-altruism.com_March_20_2016c">{{cite web |url=http://effective-altruism.com/ea/pf/why_the_open_philanthropy_project_isnt_currently/ |title=Why the Open Philanthropy Project isn't currently funding organizations focused on promoting effective altruism |newspaper=Effective Altruism Forum |date=October 28, 2015  |author=Holden Karnofsky |accessdate= March 20, 2016}}</ref>

=== Animal welfare ===

Open Phil is focusing on animal welfare.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacy-reese/what-the-chan-zuckerberg_b_8704802.html |title=What the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Could Do for Animals |date=December 3, 2015 |first=Jacy |last=Reese |publisher=''The Huffington Post'' |accessdate=March 20, 2016}}</ref> In September 2015, Holden Karnofsky announced that the Open Philanthropy Project had hired Lewis Bollard as a program officer to work on animal welfare in industrial agriculture.<ref name="Blog.givewell.org_March_20_2016c">{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2015/09/11/incoming-program-officer-lewis-bollard/ |title=Incoming Program Officer: Lewis Bollard |newspaper=Blog.givewell.org |date=September 11, 2015  |author=Holden Karnofsky |accessdate= March 20, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Animalcharityevaluators.org_March_20_2016c">{{cite web |url=http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/how-to-conduct-studies-that-will-encourage-more-effective-altruists-to-care-about-animals/ |title=How to Conduct Studies That Will Encourage More Effective Altruists to Care about Animals |newspaper=Animal Charity Evaluators |date=January 20, 2016 |author= Kieran Greig |accessdate= March 20, 2016}}</ref>

In February 2016, Open Phil announced grants of $1 million each to [[The Humane League]] and [[Mercy for Animals]] and $500,000 to [[The Humane Society of the United States]] for corporate cage-free campaigns.<ref name="open_phil_grants" /> [[Animal Charity Evaluators]] stated that this grant completely or nearly completely filled The Humane League's immediate [[room for more funding]], but that The Humane League could still grow in other areas that are not funded by the grant.<ref name="ace_thl_rfmf">{{cite web |url=https://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/update-on-thls-room-for-funding/ |title=Update on THL's Room for Funding |newspaper=Animal Charity Evaluators |date=March 18, 2016  |author= Allison Smith |accessdate= March 20, 2016}}</ref>

=== Artificial intelligence ===

In August 2015, Open Phil contributed $1.2 million to the [[Future of Life Institute]].<ref name="Betaboston.com_March_20_2016c">{{cite web |url=http://www.betaboston.com/news/2015/07/01/boston-group-awards-10m-from-elon-musk-to-jump-start-artificial-intelligence-research/ |title=Boston group awards $6m from Elon Musk to jump-start artificial intelligence research |newspaper=Beta Boston |date=July 1, 2015  |author=Elizabeth Preston |accessdate= March 20, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Bloomberg.com_March_20_2016c">{{cite web |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-01/musk-backed-group-probes-risks-behind-artificial-intelligence |title=Musk-Backed Group Probes Risks Behind Artificial Intelligence |newspaper=Bloomberg Business |date=July 1, 2015  |author=Jack Clark |accessdate=March 20, 2016}}</ref>

=== Migration liberalization ===

Open Phil is investigating "labor mobility" or migration liberalization influenced by [[Michael Clemens]] and [[Lant Pritchett]]. This has mainly been because of potential wage increases for migrating workers (particularly low-skilled workers). Open Phil published a shallow overview of the cause in May 2013. By September 2013, labor mobility had become the subject of a "deep investigation".<ref name="Openbordersinfo_March_20_2016c">{{cite web |url=http://openborders.info/blog/overview-of-the-open-philanthropy-projects-work-on-migration-liberalisation/ |title=Overview of the Open Philanthropy Project's work on migration liberalisation |newspaper=Open Borders: The Case |date=March 18, 2015 |first=Sebastian |last=Nickel |accessdate= March 20, 2016}}</ref>

=== Criminal justice reform ===

Open Phil is investigating criminal justice reform due to poor conditions in prisons and bipartisan agreement in the US. There are difficulties to this investigation because of lack of [[randomized controlled trials]] of interventions.<ref name="vox_matthews"/>

In June 2016, Holden Karnofsky announced that Open Phil had hired Chloe Cockburn (who was Advocacy and Policy Counsel for [[American Civil Liberties Union]]'s Campaign to End Mass Incarceration) as program officer for criminal justice reform.<ref name="chloe_hiring">{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2015/06/16/incoming-program-officer-for-criminal-justice-reform-chloe-cockburn/ |title=Incoming Program Officer for Criminal Justice Reform: Chloe Cockburn |newspaper=GiveWell Blog |date=June 16, 2015  |author=Holden Karnofsky |accessdate= March 20, 2016}}</ref>

== Evaluation process ==

Investigation for the Open Philanthropy Project is considered more difficult than the traditional work done for GiveWell due to the great uncertainty and inherent difficulty of comparing wildly different causes.<ref name="vox_matthews"/>

Open Phil divides its work into lower-depth investigations (also called shallow overviews), higher-depth investigations (including focus areas), and cross-cutting projects.<ref name="refining"/>

Open Phil also does "giving to learn", i.e. a process of committing to causes to better learn about them.<ref name="Blog.givewell.org_March_20_2016c">{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2014/05/14/the-importance-of-committing-to-causes/ |title=The Importance of Committing to Causes |newspaper=Blog.givewell.org |date=May 14, 2014 |author=Holden Karnofsky |accessdate= March 20, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Openbordersinfo_March_20_2016c"/><ref name="refining"/>

=== Shallow overviews ===

As part of its work related to the Open Philanthropy Project (formerly GiveWell Labs), GiveWell publishes shallow overviews of general causes.<ref name=shallow>{{cite web|url=http://givewell.org/shallow/|title = Shallow investigations of new causes|publisher = GiveWell (as part of the Open Philanthropy Project)|accessdate = 2013-09-21}}</ref> These are distinct from its charity recommendations and reviews. The first shallow overview appears to have been published in April 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.givewell.org/shallow/migration|title = Seasonal migration within low-income countries|publisher = GiveWell|date = April 2013|accessdate = 2013-09-21}}</ref> but GiveWell appears to have first officially announced shallow overviews in a blog post in May 2013.<ref name="refining">{{cite web|url=http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/30/refining-the-goals-of-givewell-labs/|title = Refining the Goals of GiveWell Labs|date = 2013-05-30|accessdate = 2013-09-21|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden|publisher = GiveWell}}</ref> As of September 2013, shallow investigations have been conducted in the areas of [[anthropogenic climate change]], detection of near-Earth [[asteroid]]s, migration (intra-country and international), [[volcano]]es, [[climate engineering|geoengineering]], [[nuclear security]], business environment, infrastructure in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], and the treatment of animals in industrial agriculture.<ref name=shallow/> GiveWell co-executive director [[Holden Karnofsky]] discussed more about the purpose of shallow overviews in a conversation with [[Giving What We Can]] representatives and other [[effective altruism|effective altruists]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jefftk.com/p/flow-through-effects-conversation|title = Flow Through Effects Conversation|date = 2013-08-31|accessdate = 2013-09-21|last = Kaufman|first = Jeff}}</ref>

== Organizational structure ==

Cari Tuna is the organization's president, [[Holden Karnofsky]] is the executive director, and Elie Hassenfeld is the managing director. Open Phil also has several program officers for various focus areas (such as US policy and scientific research), research analysts, and other roles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team |title=Team |accessdate=March 16, 2016 |publisher=Open Philanthropy Project}}</ref>

The first shallow overview appears to have been published in April 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.givewell.org/shallow/migration|title = Seasonal migration within low-income countries|publisher = GiveWell|date = April 2013|accessdate = 2013-09-21}}</ref> but GiveWell appears to have first officially announced shallow overviews in a blog post in May 2013.<ref name="refining"/>

== Grants made ==

The Open Philanthropy Project has given grants to a variety of organizations, including the Future of Life Institute for research into potential dangers of artificial intelligence<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2015/07/01/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence/ |title=Why Elon Musk is donating millions to make artificial intelligence safer |first=Jonathan |last=Vanian |date=July 1, 2015 |accessdate=March 19, 2016 |publisher=''Fortune''}}</ref> and the Center for Global Development<ref name="inside_phil_cgd"/>.

== Criticisms ==

The Open Philanthropy Project has been criticized on ''The Huffington Post'' by Leah Hunt-Hendrix for not focusing enough on systemic (or root) change and for "perpetuating inequality".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leah-hunthendrix/so-you-want-to-be-a-radical-philanthropist_b_7181248.html |title=So You Want to Be a "Radical" Philanthropist? |first=Leah |last=Hunt-Hendrix |publisher=Huffington Post |date=May 4, 2015 |accessdate=March 20, 2016}}</ref>
