== History ==

The Open Philanthropy Project started out as GiveWell Labs in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2011/09/08/announcing-givewell-labs/ |title=Announcing GiveWell Labs |date=September 8, 2011 |accessdate=March 19, 2016 |publisher=GiveWell}}</ref>

The name was changed to Open Philanthropy Project to separate it from GiveWell and also to avoid exclusive association to GiveWell because it is a collaboration with Good Ventures. However even after this initial brand change, updates to Open Phil were still posted to the GiveWell blog.<ref name="openphil_formerly_gwl" />

In April 2015, Open Phil announced a partnership with Kaitlyn Trigger and [[Mike Krieger]] (co-founder of [[Instagram]]). Trigger and Krieger pledged $750,000 over two years while Open Phil would provide information and include Trigger in team meetings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2015/04/23/co-funding-partnership-with-kaitlyn-trigger-and-mike-krieger/ |title=Co-funding Partnership with Kaitlyn Trigger and Mike Krieger |date=April 23, 2015 |accessdate=March 19, 2016 |publisher=GiveWell |first=Holden |last=Karnofsky}}</ref><ref name="vox_matthews"/>

As of March 2016, the Open Philanthropy Project is not an independent organization i.e. it is still a collaboration between GiveWell and Good Ventures, who share office space and information (to an extent).<ref name="about_page">{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/good-ventures-and-givewell |title=Good Ventures &amp; GiveWell |accessdate=March 18, 2016 |publisher=Open Philanthropy Project}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2015/12/10/december-2015-open-thread/comment-page-1/#comment-934738 |first=Elie |last=Hassenfeld |title=Comment on December 2015 Open Thread}}</ref>

== Focus areas ==

The Open Philanthropy Project uses the term "cause" to describe a problem or opportunity that requires expertise in order to make good giving decisions. It uses the term "focus area" for causes with the highest level of priority.<ref name="focus_areas">{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus |title=Focus Areas |accessdate=March 18, 2016 |publisher=Open Philanthropy Project}}</ref>

The following table lists the current (as of March 2016) focus areas for each broad category of investigation.

{| class="wikitable"
! Category !! Focus areas
|-
| US Policy || Criminal justice reform, farm animal welfare, macroeconomic stabilization policy, immigration policy, and land use reform
|-
| Global Catastrophic Risks || Biosecurity and potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence
|-
| Scientific Research || None
|-
| Global Health & Development || None
|}

=== Animal welfare ===

=== Artificial intelligence ===

=== Migration liberalization ===

=== Criminal justice reform ===

Open Phil is investigating criminal justice reform due to poor conditions in prisons and bipartisan agreement in the US. There are difficulties to this investigation because of lack of [[randomized controlled trials]] of interventions.<ref name="vox_matthews"/>

== Evaluation process ==

Investigation for the Open Philanthropy Project is considered more difficult than the traditional work done for GiveWell due to the great uncertainty and inherent difficulty of comparing wildly different causes.<ref name="vox_matthews"/>

=== Shallow overviews ===

As part of its work related to the Open Philanthropy Project (formerly GiveWell Labs), GiveWell publishes shallow overviews of general causes.<ref name=shallow>{{cite web|url=http://givewell.org/shallow/|title = Shallow investigations of new causes|publisher = GiveWell (as part of the Open Philanthropy Project)|accessdate = 2013-09-21}}</ref> These are distinct from its charity recommendations and reviews.

== Organizational structure ==

== Criticisms ==

The Open Philanthropy Project has been criticized on ''The Huffington Post'' by Leah Hunt-Hendrix for not focusing enough on systemic (or root) change and for "perpetuating inequality".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leah-hunthendrix/so-you-want-to-be-a-radical-philanthropist_b_7181248.html |title=So You Want to Be a "Radical" Philanthropist? |first=Leah |last=Hunt-Hendrix |publisher=Huffington Post |date=May 4, 2015 |accessdate=March 20, 2016}}</ref>
