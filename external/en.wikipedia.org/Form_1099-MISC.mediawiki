In the United States, '''Form 1099-MISC''' is a variant of [[Form 1099]] used to report miscellaneous income.

One notable use of Form 1099-MISC is to report amounts paid by a business (including nonprofits<ref name="i1099msc" />{{rp|1}}) to a non-corporate US resident [[independent contractor]] for services (in IRS terminology, such payments are ''nonemployee compensation''). The ubiquity of the form has also led to use of the phrase "1099 workers" or "the 1099 economy" to refer to the independent contractors themselves.<ref>Forbes, The Rise of The 1099 Economy: More Americans Are Becoming Their Own Bosses, http://www.forbes.com/sites/joelkotkin/2012/07/25/the-rise-of-the-1099-economy-more-americans-are-becoming-their-own-bosses/</ref>

Other uses of Form 1099-MISC include rental income, royalties, and [[Native American gaming|Indian gaming profits]].<ref name="efile_howto" />

The form is issued by the payer (e.g. business) and is due to the recipient (e.g. employee) by January 31 and to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] by February 28 each year for work done during the previous tax year.<ref name="penalties">{{cite web |url=https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/Small-Business-Taxes/Penalties-for-Not-Filing-a-1099-Misc-IRS-Form/INF19313.html |title=Penalties for Not Filing a 1099-Misc IRS Form |accessdate=January 19, 2016 |date=2015}}</ref><ref name="efile_howto">{{cite web|url = http://www.efile.com/how-to-file-1099-online-irs-form-1096/|title = What If I Have to Issue a 1099 Form?|publisher = efile.com|accessdate = January 16, 2016}}</ref> For electronic payments ...

== Conditions ==

Several conditions apply regarding whether a business or individual must file Form 1099-MISC.

=== Payer must be a business ===

In general, Form 1099-MISC is used for trade or business reporting. This means personal payments should not be reported using this form. On the other hand, nonprofits and other organizations must file this form.<ref name="i1099msc">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1099msc.pdf |title=2016 Instructions for Form 1099-MISC |accessdate=January 19, 2016 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}</ref>{{rp|1}}

In particular, whether an income is taxable and whether it should be reported on Form 1099-MISC are distinct questions. There may be other forms, such as Form W-2 (for wages) or Form 1099-K (for payments made with a credit card) that must be filed instead.<ref name="i1099msc" />

Rule of thumb: Item must be reportable as a business expense (regardless of whether the business chooses to actually report it that way?)

Interesting counterpoint: In the case of nonresidents for tax purposes (incl. undocumented aliens) the corresponding form to Form 1099 (Form 1042-S) must be issued even if the payer is a private individual. So e.g. if you hire household help, then if the help is a U.S. citizen or resident for tax purposes then you don't need to issue a Form 1099, but if the payee is an undocumented alien you need to issue a Form 1042-S.

=== Payee must be an individual ===

In particular doesn't include business-to-business payments.

=== Payment must be in exchange for services rendered (?) ===

So e.g. scholarship payments don't count.

=== Payment must be for work not performed as an employee ===

Employee payments are covered by Form W-2.

Though it's possible that the same payee later becomes an employee.

=== Payments made through third-party networks don't require Form 1099-MISC ===

Because they're covered by Form 1099-K. But Form 1099-MISC may still be issued.

=== Form 1099-MISC needs to be issued only for amount &gt;= $600 ===

If total amount paid through the year from the one business to the one employee is $600 or more, the form must be issued.

* This condition is triggered even if individual payment amounts are all &lt; $600.
* Only includes payments made as independent contractor, so e.g. if same person becomes employee later the $600 threshold need be met only for part of work done as independent contractor.

Form may still be issued at lower amounts.

== Significance for payer ==

=== Liability ===

If the payer does not file Form 1099-MISC, there is a maximum penalty of $250 per form not filed, up to $500,000 per year. Otherwise for late filings the penalty varies from $30 to $100, depending on how late the filing was.<ref name="penalties" />

=== Relation with payer's tax filing ===

* No precise match between total of Form 1099-MISC's issued and any line item in profit/loss report, because of constraint of not reporting money paid for &lt; $600.

* However, IRS may get suspicious if profit/loss report suggests huge amount of money paid to independent contractors but few or no Form 1099-MISCs reported.

== Significance for payee ==

* What line number in Form 1040? What schedules (SE, C)
* IRS gets Form 1099-MISCs, so if payee reports a smaller total than sum of Form 1099-MISCs, IRS can get suspicious.

=== Liability ===

There is a penalty to the payee for not paying income tax for the income referenced by Form 1099-MISC. The penalty is up to 20% of the underpayment.<ref name="penalties" />

=== Related forms ===

* However, sum of Form 1099-MISC amounts may not cover all of payee's income as independent contractor (because of people who don't issue the form because of the $600 threshold or because they're careless). Payee still has a responsibility. namely that another reason the Form 1099-MISCs may not sum up to total income is if the income comes from individual payers rather than businesses

* Discuss confusion arising from multiple reporting due to Form 1099-MISC and Form 1099-K.

* Best to just track and total payments, and make sure that Form 1099-MISC sum is less than total income reported.

* If not, ask payer to correct record (and send update to IRS as well).

* Payee gets Form 1099-MISC before IRS, so can correct errors before sent to IRS.

=== Withholding and estimated tax payment ===

Form 1099 need not be attached to the payee's tax return if no tax was withheld.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://classroom.synonym.com/need-attach-1099-forms-federal-tax-return-7577.html |title=Do You Need to Attach 1099 Forms to a Federal Tax Return? |first=Naomi |last=Smith |accessdate=January 1, 2015}}</ref> In general, employer-sent forms are used to substantiate claims of withholding, so only forms that involve withholding need to be attached.

In almost all cases, income associated with Form 1099-MISC is not subject to withholding. However, income from [[Indian_Gaming_Regulatory_Act#Three_classes|class II or class III gaming]] as an Indian tribal member must be withheld.<ref name=i1099msc />{{rp|4}}

No income withholding at source, for either income tax or social security tax. (really?) (Can you optionally turn on withholding?)

People whose income is primarily from Form 1099-MISC therefore need to send estimated tax payments through EFTPS or by paper-filing Form 1040-ES with a check.

Even those who don't need to pay income tax may still owe some SS/Medicare taxes. So very low-income folks who are self-employed may "need" to file returns whereas comparable folks who are other-employed may not.

== Optional ==

* History/origin of the form

* Top users (companies)

* Total annual usage
