In the United States, '''Form 1099-MISC''' is a variant of [[Form 1099]] used to report miscellaneous income. One notable use of Form 1099-MISC is to report amounts paid by a business (including nonprofits<ref name="i1099msc" />{{rp|1}}) to a non-corporate US resident [[independent contractor]] for services (in IRS terminology, such payments are ''nonemployee compensation''). The ubiquity of the form has also led to use of the phrase "1099 workers" or "the 1099 economy" to refer to the independent contractors themselves.<ref>Forbes, The Rise of The 1099 Economy: More Americans Are Becoming Their Own Bosses, http://www.forbes.com/sites/joelkotkin/2012/07/25/the-rise-of-the-1099-economy-more-americans-are-becoming-their-own-bosses/</ref> Other uses of Form 1099-MISC include rental income, royalties, and [[Native American gaming|Indian gaming profits]].<ref name="efile_howto" />

The form is issued by the payer (e.g. business) and is due to the recipient (e.g. contractor) by January 31 and to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] by February 28 each year for work done during the previous tax year.<ref name="penalties">{{cite web |url=https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/Small-Business-Taxes/Penalties-for-Not-Filing-a-1099-Misc-IRS-Form/INF19313.html |title=Penalties for Not Filing a 1099-Misc IRS Form |accessdate=January 19, 2016 |date=2015}}</ref><ref name="efile_howto">{{cite web|url = http://www.efile.com/how-to-file-1099-online-irs-form-1096/|title = What If I Have to Issue a 1099 Form?|publisher = efile.com|accessdate = January 16, 2016}}</ref> If the payer is registered to file electronically with the IRS the deadline for filing is March 31.<ref name="i1099gi">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1099gi.pdf |title=2016 General Instructions for Certain Information Returns |accessdate=January 20, 2016 |date=2016}}</ref>

== Use cases ==

There are several use cases of Form 1099-MISC. Whether an income is taxable and whether it should be reported on Form 1099-MISC are distinct questions. There may be other forms, such as Form W-2 (for wages) or Form 1099-K (for payments made with a credit card) that must be filed instead.<ref name="i1099msc" />

=== Business–contractor arrangement ===

One common use of Form 1099-MISC is to report payments by a business to US resident independent contractors. For the purpose of this form, "business" includes nonprofits and other organizations.<ref name="i1099msc">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1099msc.pdf |title=2016 Instructions for Form 1099-MISC |accessdate=January 19, 2016 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}</ref>{{rp|1}}

In a business–contractor arrangement, the following must apply:

* Payer must be a business and not a private individual; personal payments should not be reported using this form.
* Payee must not be a business or employee (so must be a contract worker). Employee payments are covered by Form W-2.
* In general, payment must be in exchange for services rendered, although there are exceptions like oil and gas payments.<ref name="i1099msc" />{{rp|7}}

It is possible for a payee to start as a contractor and later become an employee. It is also possible for a payee to maintain two jobs, one as a contractor and the other as an employee, under the same payer. In these cases, the payee can receive both Form 1099-MISC and Form W-2.<ref name="chron">{{cite web |url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/give-1099-w2-same-person-32664.html |title=How to Give a 1099 and W-2 to the Same Person |accessdate=January 20, 2016 |last=Zias |first=Kerry}}</ref><ref name="hrmorning">{{cite web |url=http://www.hrmorning.com/workers-can-be-both-employees-and-ics-irs-rules/ |title=Workers can be both employees and ICs, IRS rules |accessdate=January 20, 2016 |date=May 24, 2013 |last=Gould |first=Tim}}</ref>

Form 1099-MISC needs to be issued only for amount ≥ $600

Form may still be issued at lower amounts.

If total amount paid through the year from the one business to the one contractor is $600 or more, the form must be issued. This is the case even if individual payment amounts are all less than $600. However, since Form 1099-MISC only concerns payments made to an individual as an independent contractor, if an individual becomes employee later the $600 threshold need be met only for part of work done as an independent contractor.

===Other use cases===

Other uses of Form 1099-MISC include rental income, royalties, and [[Native American gaming|Indian gaming profits]].<ref name="efile_howto" />

=== Payments made through third-party networks ===

When payments are made through third-party networks, filing Form 1099-MISC is not required. Instead, Form 1099-K should be filed. Nevertheless Form 1099-MISC may still be issued.

=== Nonresident payee ===

A major difference exists for personal payments when the payee is a nonresident for tax purposes (including undocumented alien). In this case, Form 1042-S (the corresponding form to Form 1099-MISC) must be issued even if the payer is a private individual (i.e. not a business or other organization). For instance, if one hires household help, then if the help is a US citizen or resident for tax purposes one need not issue a Form 1099, but if the payee is an undocumented alien one must issue a Form 1042-S.<ref name="pers_serv">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Pay-for-Personal-Services-Performed |title=Pay for Personal Services Performed |accessdate=January 20, 2016}}</ref>

== Significance for payer ==

=== Liability ===

If the payer does not file Form 1099-MISC, there is a maximum penalty of $250 per form not filed, up to $500,000 per year. Otherwise for late filings the penalty varies from $30 to $100, depending on how late the filing was.<ref name="penalties" />

=== Relation with payer's tax filing ===

* No precise match between total of Form 1099-MISC's issued and any line item in profit/loss report, because of constraint of not reporting money paid for &lt; $600.

* However, IRS may get suspicious if profit/loss report suggests huge amount of money paid to independent contractors but few or no Form 1099-MISCs reported.

== Significance for payee ==

The payee will usually complete a Schedule C while filing their individual return using [[Form 1040]] (amount from Schedule C will go on line 12). For rents and loyalties, Schedule E is required (amount from this will go to line 17 of Form 1040).<ref name="penalties" />

* IRS gets Form 1099-MISCs, so if payee reports a smaller total than sum of Form 1099-MISCs, IRS can get suspicious.

=== Liability ===

There is a penalty to the payee for not paying income tax for the income referenced by Form 1099-MISC. The penalty is up to 20% of the underpayment.<ref name="penalties" />

=== Related forms ===

* However, sum of Form 1099-MISC amounts may not cover all of payee's income as independent contractor (because of people who don't issue the form because of the $600 threshold or because they're careless). Payee still has a responsibility. namely that another reason the Form 1099-MISCs may not sum up to total income is if the income comes from individual payers rather than businesses

* Discuss confusion arising from multiple reporting due to Form 1099-MISC and Form 1099-K.

* Best to just track and total payments, and make sure that Form 1099-MISC sum is less than total income reported.

* If not, ask payer to correct record (and send update to IRS as well).

* Payee gets Form 1099-MISC before IRS, so can correct errors before sent to IRS.

=== Withholding and estimated tax payment ===

Form 1099 need not be attached to the payee's tax return if no tax was withheld.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://classroom.synonym.com/need-attach-1099-forms-federal-tax-return-7577.html |title=Do You Need to Attach 1099 Forms to a Federal Tax Return? |first=Naomi |last=Smith |accessdate=January 1, 2015}}</ref> In general, employer-sent forms are used to substantiate claims of withholding, so only forms that involve withholding need to be attached.

In almost all cases, income associated with Form 1099-MISC is not subject to withholding. However, income from [[Indian_Gaming_Regulatory_Act#Three_classes|class II or class III gaming]] as an Indian tribal member must be withheld.<ref name=i1099msc />{{rp|4}}

No income withholding at source, for either income tax or social security tax. (really?) (Can you optionally turn on withholding?)

Withholding requirements are different for nonresident payees, in which case [[Form 1042-S]] is used instead.

People whose income is primarily from Form 1099-MISC therefore need to send estimated tax payments through EFTPS or by paper-filing Form 1040-ES with a check.

Even those who don't need to pay income tax may still owe some SS/Medicare taxes. So very low-income folks who are self-employed may "need" to file returns whereas comparable folks who are other-employed may not.
