'''Form W-9''', '''Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification''', is used in the [[Taxation in the United States|United States]] [[income tax]] system by a third party who must file an information return with the IRS. It requests the taxpayer identification information of a taxpayer (usually in the form of a [[Social Security Number]] or [[Tax Identification Number]]).

The form is never actually sent to the IRS, but is maintained by the person who files the information return for verification purposes.
