[Long Content](http://www.gwern.net/About#long-content) is an idea set forth by gwern regarding his website.
As gwern writes, the idea follows from thinking in the [Long Now](!w)-style.

[Leonard Woolf on Virginia Woolf](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91h/preface.html):

> All through her life, Virginia Woolf used at intervals to write short stories. It was her custom, whenever an idea for one occurred to her, to sketch it out in a very rough form and then to put it away in a drawer. Later, if an editor asked her for a short story, and she felt in the mood to write one (which was not frequent), she would take a sketch out of her drawer and rewrite it, sometimes a great many times. Or if she felt, as she often did, while writing a novel that she required to rest her mind by working at something else for a time, she would either write a critical essay or work upon one of her sketches for short stories.

It's worth noting that while many authors/writers (and English teachers) keep telling people to rewrite, [Bertrand Russell](!w), for one, [has found something else](http://www.personal.kent.edu/~rmuhamma/Philosophy/RBwritings/howWrite.htm):

> I conscientiously tried [to rewrite], but found that my first draft was almost always better than my second. This discovery has saved me an immense amount of time. I do not, of course, apply it to the substance, but only to the form. When I discover an error of an important kind I re-write the whole. What I do not find is that I can improve a sentence when I am satisfied with what it means.[^florid]

The essay also contains the anecdote about when Russell "proceeded to dictate the whole book without a moment's hesitation".

(Hmm, now this page is talking also about [How to write]() and [Revising one's writings](); perhaps these need separate pages.)

[^florid]: Also I love this quote:
"There was a time, in the first years of this century, when I had more florid and rhetorical ambitions."
