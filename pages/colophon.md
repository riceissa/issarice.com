- Pages written manually using Vim and the Pandoc Markdown markup.
- CSS is compressed by Hakyll, but the uncompressed version is available [here](https://github.com/riceissa/riceissa.com/blob/master/css/minimal.css); it uses [Ethan Schoonover](http://ethanschoonover.com/)'s light [solarized theme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized), as well as taking hints from GitHub's docs pages.
- Site source hosted on GitHub
- Markdown files compiled to HTML using Hakyll[^hak], a static site generator
- Website hosted on Linode, using Apache 2 on a 64-bit Debian 7.5 machine
- Domain names <http://riceissa.com> and <http://issarice.com> registered through Hover

[^hak]: I should eventually write out the details of this, and explain what goes into the `site.hs` file.
