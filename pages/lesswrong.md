Depending on your personality fit with the community, [Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/) may be a very good place to check out.
Some posts to check out (FIXME: make this part more fluid later):

Less Wrong is also a good place to find other resources.

- Some of the best content on Less Wrong might just be pointers to other high quality resources.
“[The Best Textbooks on Every Subject](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gu/the_best_textbooks_on_every_subject/)” was the post that first got me excited about Less Wrong.
Also [References \& Resources for LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2un/references_resources_for_lesswrong/) is excellent.

- [Diseased thinking: dissolving questions about disease](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2as/diseased_thinking_dissolving_questions_about/) asks the questions "What is disease?" and considers when it is appropriate to sympathize with or prod a victim of a "disease".

- [The noncentral fallacy - the worst argument in the world?](http://lesswrong.com/lw/e95/the_noncentral_fallacy_the_worst_argument_in_the/)

- find more high school-related posts.

- books are declining in importance compared to material one can find on the internet; see “[Yes, a blog.](http://lesswrong.com/lw/33j/yes_a_blog/)”

[maybe insert a guide in here of how to effectively use LW]
