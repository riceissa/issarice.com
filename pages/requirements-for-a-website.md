What makes a good website, especially one that lasts a long time?
gwern has some ideas, namely his twin ideas of [Long Site](http://www.gwern.net/About#long-site) and [Long Content]().
gwern quotes Julian Assange, but it is worth doing so here as well[^assange]:

Regarding his publishing system, he writes, "it's gold until civilization collapses, the neoluddites take control, or both, but then we will have other adventures to please us...".

Here are some general principles to keep in mind (copied from gwern's list under "Long Site"):

- Use plain text (what are some reasons? gwern links to "[The Importance of Being Textual](http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch05s01.html)")
- Use free software
- Avoid external dependencies
    - So no URL shorteners, as quoted in the footnotes on gwern's site
    - What about the DuckDuckGo style links, like [this](!g)?---hmm, this would be fairly simple to fix though, even if DDG went down.---plus, links themselves are an external dependency; trusting DDG is better than trusting any old website. In the end, what will lead to more [durable link]()s?
    - using awesome-slugify?
- staticness (are there any good reasons for this? gwern doesn't provide any)

---

-   compatibility with git
-   ability to use math (LaTeX, mathjax, images if desperate)
-   some option for single-source publishing? (to PDF [to print] and
    HTML would be nice)
-   *not* WYSIWYG (because let's be honest, WYSIWYG isn't very good in
    terms of producing precise content)\
-   but must have mostly readable syntax (LaTeX is fine, since I'm so
    used to it, but HTML is ugly); Markdown-type syntax is great
-   content must stay on a local drive, and be "pushed" to a possibly
    off-site place for hosting (like Github)
-   ability to merge different sources; e.g. one person writes an
    article, another works on it by adding a few things; but if the
    first person does not want the changes of the second person, yet the
    second person wants changes from the first person, then the second
    must be able to keep pulling changes from the first. <span
