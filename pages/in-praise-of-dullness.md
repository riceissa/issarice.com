[^stafford]: William Stafford.
"Burning a Book".
[*Ask me: 100 Essential Poems of William Stafford*](https://books.google.com/books?id=AaOxAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT108&ots=TYENZlX5rT&dq=burning%20a%20book%20stafford&pg=PT108#v=onepage&q=burning%20a%20book%20stafford&f=false).

Dullness has possibly already been praised enough times in different forms.
There is, for instance, Bertrand Russell's [*In Praise of Dullness*](https://books.google.com/books?id=_qfrAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA70&ots=-BIIsJkOot&dq=bertrand%20russell%20in%20praise%20of%20dullness&pg=PA70#v=onepage&q&f=false)[^idleness]

[^idleness]: Not to be confused with his [*In Praise of Idleness*](http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html).

Then there is David Brooks, writing for the New York Times: "[In Praise of Dullness](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/19/opinion/19brooks.html)".

[Noam Chomsky on sports](http://www.alternet.org/noam-chomsky-why-americans-know-so-much-about-sports-so-little-about-world-affairs):

> When I'm driving, I sometimes turn on the radio and I find very often that what I'm listening to is a discussion of sports. These are telephone conversations. People call in and have long and intricate discussions, and it's plain that quite a high degree of thought and analysis is going into that. People know a tremendous amount. They know all sorts of complicated details and enter into far-reaching discussion about whether the coach made the right decision yesterday and so on. These are ordinary people, not professionals, who are applying their intelligence and analytic skills in these areas and accumulating quite a lot of knowledge and, for all I know, understanding. On the other hand, when I hear people talk about, say, international affairs or domestic problems, it's at a level of superficiality that's beyond belief.
> 
> In part, this reaction may be due to my own areas of interest, but I think it's quite accurate, basically. And I think that this concentration on such topics as sports makes a certain degree of sense. The way the system is set up, there is virtually nothing people can do anyway, without a degree of organization that's far beyond anything that exists now, to influence the real world. They might as well live in a fantasy world, and that's in fact what they do. I'm sure they are using their common sense and intellectual skills, but in an area which has no meaning and probably thrives because it has no meaning, as a displacement from the serious problems which one cannot influence and affect because the power happens to lie elsewhere.

This is not an isolated case of the remark:

> Take, say, sports -- that's another crucial example of the indoctrination system, in my view. For one thing because it -- you know, it offers people something to pay attention to that's of no importance. [audience laughs] That keeps them from worrying about -- [applause] keeps them from worrying about things that matter to their lives that they might have some idea of doing something about. And in fact it's striking to see the intelligence that's used by ordinary people in [discussions of] sports [as opposed to political and social issues]. I mean, you listen to radio stations where people call in -- they have the most exotic information [more laughter] and understanding about all kind of arcane issues. And the press undoubtedly does a lot with this.

But "dullness" is just another way of saying "boringness"; and of boringness there is already some praise indeed.
See for instance Qiaochu Yuan in "[Boring Advice Repository](http://lesswrong.com/lw/gx5/boring_advice_repository/)" on Less Wrong:

> It seems plausible that, when giving advice, many people optimize for deepness or punchiness of the advice rather than for actual practical value. There may be good reasons to do this - e.g. advice that sounds deep or punchy might be more likely to be listened to - but as a corollary, there could be valuable advice that people generally don't give because it doesn't sound deep or punchy. Let's call this **boring advice**.
