My main contributions to Quora are through my questions, but I don't think my answers are especially bad, so here they are.

Reverse chronological order

# What was it like to attend the Seattle Quora meetup on October 24, 2014?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-to-attend-the-Seattle-Quora-meetup-on-October-24-2014)

I think the conversations that happened at
the meetup this time were a lot like those of past meetups. What made
this meetup unique was that we couldn't agree on a good place to meet,
so ended up talking outside of the RAM from 6:00pm to around 7:30(?)pm.
We ended up waiting in line for the RAM but there was difficulty
acquiring a table (the restaurant wanted to split the group into two
tables). I eventually had to leave before the group even got a table.

Some other notable points:

-   Everyone did manage to get the new Quora shirt.
-   There were several new people attending the meetup.
-   The group again did seem to mostly be people associated with UW.


# Is anyone interested in a study partner system at the University of Washington?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/Is-anyone-interested-in-a-study-partner-system-at-the-University-of-Washington/answer/Issa-Rice)

As the asker of this question, I am highly interested.

# Who is interested in an effective altruism group/club at the University of Washington?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/Who-is-interested-in-an-effective-altruism-group-club-at-the-University-of-Washington/answer/Issa-Rice)


As the asker of this question, I am highly interested in such a group. I
don't have a lot of experience with effective altruism yet though. I
also don't have experience with typical leadership positions like in
high school clubs, so I'm not sure about trying to start it just on my
own—although I'd definitely be willing to give it a try. (But in any
case, if very few people are interested, then it might not be worth the
effort to attempt to start a group).

# How has the way Vipul Naik uses Facebook changed the way you think about social media?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/How-has-the-way-Vipul-Naik-uses-Facebook-changed-the-way-you-think-about-social-media/answer/Issa-Rice)

Slightly modified version of what I posted on Facebook:

Vipul's bleg-style posts on Facebook have definitely opened my eyes to what's possible on Facebook. I originally joined Facebook for networking in college (as well as to join a certain discussion group), but honestly wasn't expecting too much out of Facebook (which I had thought of as a place where people post generally inane status updates). Over the six months I've been on Facebook, I've learned that as long as one is willing to curate one's Facebook feed enough, the signal-to-noise ratio can surpass that of Quora, and rival that of sites like Less Wrong. Sebastian Nickel's post praising Vipul comes to mind. To be sure, I realize that Vipul's style of posting isn't unique, but he seems to be one of the better people posting in this style.

# How can I implement cool URIs with Hakyll?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-implement-cool-URIs-with-Hakyll/answer/Issa-Rice)


In the Hakyll configuration file, do something like `route $ setExtension ""`, which will remove the `.html` extension from the generated file.
See also the discussion at [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21msg/hakyll/XewxMLIjRIw/hBDnD3iXLMwJ).

Really, the main thing is to have the server set the default MIME type
to `text/html` so that these extensionless files are seen as valid HTML files by browsers.
Note that if you're hosting on something like GitHub pages, then this is not possible (see [Can MIME types of Github Pages files be configured?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15951012/can-mime-types-of-github-pages-files-be-configured)), which is why many people set up Jekyll/Hakyll to make separate directories for each page with an `index.html` in each so that the URLs will still look pretty (so you can go to both `example.com/page-name/` and `example.com/page-name/index.html`).


# What music does Issa Rice listen to?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/What-music-does-Issa-Rice-listen-to/answer/Issa-Rice)


Mostly mainstream Western music from a few decades back: Bob Dylan, The
Beatles, The Kinks, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Velvet
Underground (roughly in that order). I've also fairly recently
discovered [Sidi
Touré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidi_Tour%C3%A9), [Detektivbyrån](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detektivbyr%C3%A5n),
[Jean Michel
Jarre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Michel_Jarre), [Jean-Luc
Ponty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Ponty), mostly
through my father.

I also like some simple Japanese songs like [Aogeba
Tōtoshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aogeba_T%C5%8Dtoshi) and
[赤とんぼ (童謡) -
Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%B5%A4%E3%81%A8%E3%82%93%E3%81%BC_%28%E7%AB%A5%E8%AC%A1%29)
(Red Dragonfly). Also João Gilberto's Chega De Saudade (even though I've
never bothered to look up any of the lyrics) and Antonio Carlos Jobim's
Stone Flower.

I do sometimes wonder why I don't listen as much to Japanese music. It
may be that since I've spent all my teenage years (when I first got
interested in listening to music) in the US, my musical tastes were
influenced that way.

I'm open to suggestions (e.g. sometimes [Kristin
Lie](https://www.quora.com/Kristin-Lie) will show me a song), but
I feel I've mostly discovered what I like, so I don't spend time
actively searching for new things to listen to. Finding more Japanese
songs I like would be especially nice though.

I should also mention that I can go for long periods (weeks) without
listening to any music. It might just be that my collection is so small
I get bored of it quickly, but can come back to it after some amount of
time has passed.

# Does Issa Rice watch anime?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/Does-Issa-Rice-watch-anime/answer/Issa-Rice)


Not anymore. When I was younger and lived in Japan, I used to watch
quite a bit (there are usually evening anime around 5pm–7pm in Japan,
and I used to watch that). I also remember being obsessed about [Digimon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digimon),
which used to (not sure if this is still true) come on around 7am or 8am
on Saturdays. In fact I was so obsessed that I got my parents to record
it onto videotapes every week (might still have those somewhere). I
remember being very upset once when we forgot to record it.

Other anime I remember watching: [Pokémon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon),
[Yakitate!!
Japan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakitate%21%21_Japan), [Doraemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doraemon),
[Chibi
Maruko-chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chibi_Maruko-chan),
and [Sazae-san](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sazae-san).
(There probably are more.)

When I got older and moved to the US, I briefly got excited about [笑ゥせぇるすまん -
Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%AC%91%E3%82%A5%E3%81%9B%E3%81%87%E3%82%8B%E3%81%99%E3%81%BE%E3%82%93)
(Laughing Salesman), which has a fantastic depiction of a hedonistic
Japan.

I also remember liking [The Girl Who Leapt
Through Time (2006
film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_Who_Leapt_Through_Time_%282006_film%29).

# How often do you check the edit history to see the author of a question?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/How-often-do-you-check-the-edit-history-to-see-the-author-of-a-question/answer/Issa-Rice)

If the question is about someone on Quora, then I like to check who asked it. (This helps me build a better mental model of which Quora users like asking personal questions, like receiving them, etc., as well as letting me see which users interact with each other.)

If a question is particularly interesting or elaborately formulated, then I'm more inclined to check as well.

I'm less likely to check when I'm on the mobile app since I have to open an external browser to check.

As for how often this actually happens, I'd guess maybe once or twice a day.

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-only-the-first-item-of-a-list-show-up-when-using-pandoc-and-YAML-headers/answer/Issa-Rice)


Answering my own question since I figured it out. Indeed only the first
item seems to be bound to the variable, but using for-loops we can
obtain the other values as well. See [Listing tags using pandoc and YAML
header](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25559469/listing-tags-using-pandoc-and-yaml-header)
[1] for more on how to do this for the specific case of listing tags.

# Are there translations websites of Quora content?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/Are-there-translations-websites-of-Quora-content/answer/Issa-Rice)


For Japanese, there is [Knoh (ノウ) | The
Knowledge Hub](http://knoh.jp), which, as of August 2014, seems
to have around 60 answers on Quora translated (with the original answer
side-by-side, like [初めて起業するアントレプレナーたちが、もっともよくやってしまう過ちはなんですか？
| Knoh (ノウ)](http://knoh.jp/answers/289014)). It seems to be
the efforts of a small group of people, and there doesn't seem to be a
sign up feature, so I'm not sure how much it will expand. They do say on
[Knoh について | Knoh
(ノウ)](http://knoh.jp/about) that in the future they're planning
to publicly allow transaltions through the cloud. Also there does seem
to be a fairly active hashtag devoted to it on Twitter at [Twitter / Search -
\#knoh](https://twitter.com/hashtag/knoh) as well as an official
account at [Knoh (公式) (knoh\_jp) on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/knoh_jp).

# What does Issa Rice think of Andrew J. Ho's post-graduation plans?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/What-does-Issa-Rice-think-of-Andrew-J-Hos-post-graduation-plans/answer/Issa-Rice)


I'm not an expert on the subject, so I hope [Vipul
Naik](https://www.quora.com/Vipul-Naik) can provide a better
answer, but here are some thoughts.

-   Admittedly my first reaction was one of bewilderment, mostly because
    I don't know anyone (smart) who is even remotely interested in
    pursuing personal tutoring. I suppose I just hadn't considered this
    at all until now, which probably shows in this answer.
-   In general I seem to associate the test prep industry with
    compulsory schooling in the US in general, and my impression isn't
    very positive [1, 2]. I'm still split on the question of time
    allocation for high school students. [3] In general I'm a lot more
    interested in extremely long-term goals rather than relatively
    short-term ones, and I think test prep falls under the latter. I
    suppose if the opportunity is lucrative enough, then it might be
    worth it. [4]
-   I am however very much interested when you mention teaching more
    advanced topics. I sometimes wish there were local groups that
    extended Cognito Mentoring, and if your plan could evolve to
    accomplish that (while, say, paying for maintenance/development with
    donations and the money earned from doing test prep), then I'd be
    very interested.
-   Your description [5] of the local area is consistent with what I
    have observed, but again I'm not an expert.
-   I suppose I can evaluate your plans personally, and consider whether
    I would take a similar path, although even this is a bit difficult
    since I haven't even begun college yet: for myself, my relative lack
    of experience with standardized tests makes the prospect fall apart
    immediately, though I would consider helping high school students
    per the Cognito Mentoring plan given above.

=\=\=\=\=\
[1]\: See for example [Education
Disruption](http://education-disruption.quora.com). From what
I've observed, you seem to have similar views.

[2]\: On the other hand, Cognito Mentoring, for instance, takes a neutral
stance regarding [Standardized
tests](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Standardized_tests).

[3]\: See for instance [High school extracurricular activities: factors to consider](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/High_school_extracurricular_activities:_factors_to_consider) and [High school extracurricular activities: suggestions](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/High_school_extracurricular_activities:_suggestions).
During my own high school career, I tended to eschew studying for
standardized tests altogether. Still, one can ask whether, given that
students shouldn't spend time on test prep, whether one should still
seek a career in it to "extort money from the oblivious", or similar.

[4]\: Though with money, I now just think of it in terms of effective
altruism and earning-to-give.

[5]\: Specifically,

> In  the local area, there are a lot of affluent Asian immigrants with
> lots  of disposable income. There's also no private/boarding school

# Why has the Cognito Mentoring blog on Quora been dormant recently?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/Why-has-the-Cognito-Mentoring-blog-on-Quora-been-dormant-recently/answer/Issa-Rice)


Cognito Mentoring is now in "maintenance mode"; see [Moving on from Cognito
Mentoring](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k8q/moving_on_from_cognito_mentoring/)
for more. Specifically (taken from the post),

As for why it is in "maintenance mode", the conclusion puts it
concisely:

> Cognito Mentoring for other pursuits. The material that we have

# How does Quora deal with question URLs if a question is edited but then a new question is added with the exact wording of the old question?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/How-does-Quora-deal-with-question-URLs-if-a-question-is-edited-but-then-a-new-question-is-added-with-the-exact-wording-of-the-old-question/answer/Issa-Rice)


Both the old and new URLs for the original question go to the original
question; the new question gets its own URL entirely.

Here's what I did. I asked "What is Quora's policy on test questions?",
which first created [https://www.quora.com/What-is-Quoras-policy-on-test-questions](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Quora-policy-on-test-questions).
Then I changed that wording to "What is the Quora policy on test
questions?", which generated a new URL for that question, <https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Quora-policy-on-test-questions>.
Then I added a new question with the exact wording of the old question,
"What is Quora's policy on test questions?". This new question got the
URL <https://www.quora.com/What-is-Quoras-policy-on-test-questions-1>.
Meanwhile, both of the first two links go to the first question.


# What are some of the best questions and answers you have come across recently (July 2014) on Quora?

# What is it like to attend the Friday pizza lunch on the astronomy floor at the University of Washington?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-attend-the-Friday-pizza-lunch-on-the-astronomy-floor-at-the-University-of-Washington/answer/Issa-Rice)


I went to one during the summer, so I'm not quite sure if the atmosphere
I experienced was usual. Essentially, someone goes out to buy three(?)
large pizzas[2] and some drinks (canned Coca Cola) and everyone else
pays \$2.50 a slice to eat.[1] Everyone sits or stands around in the
lounge (which is sort of more like a hallway with chairs), and chats a
bit. I think most of the people there were professors/researchers or
graduate students. I felt a bit out of place as I was one of the only
undergraduates/prefrosh. What I ended up doing was standing in the room
next to the lounge/hallway with [Kristin
Lie](https://www.quora.com/Kristin-Lie) and [Lilian
Liang](https://www.quora.com/Lilian-Liang).

If I end up going again, I'd like to (1) try talking to people about
astronomy/the astronomy major at UW/the astronomy research at UW; (2) go
during the regular school year to see if the summertime was unique; (3)
update this answer accordingly.


=\=\=\=\=\
[1]\: Although, for myself, I had brought lunch so I ate that instead of
the pizza.

[2]\: I did hear someone say that the pizza slices tend to run out fast,
although when I went there seemed to be (just) enough for everyone.



# Is it true that preschoolers in Japan are starting to wear wide brimmed hats and sunglasses to protect from sunlight?

As [Sed

widely adopted, but one school at least has adopted this[1], and was
recently on the news for it. Observe:

The school does seem to be a private school: [埼玉県さいたま市緑区 学校法人古里学園 大古里

regular wide brimmed ones, so [Alex K.  Chen](https://www.quora.com/Alex-K-Chen) may be disappointed.

# What is it like to go to the UW A&O (for freshmen)?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-go-to-the-UW-A-O-for-freshmen/answer/Issa-Rice)


Some thoughts (from the 2014 A&O):

-   I am not convinced that the A&O required two days. The total time
    required to attend fully is 16.5 hours, and I felt that the
    important parts (getting one's Husky Card, signing up for classes,
    asking questions, getting to know some students) didn't really
    require this entire time. It almost felt like the university itself
    was not confident that students would stay, so had to implement
    measures to force students to stay the full time. (To illustrate,
    they didn't tell you the schedule for the second day on the first
    day, they scared students into coming on time on the second day[1],
    course registration was during the second day, and they didn't hand
    out the Husky Cards until the very end of the second day, even
    though photos were taken much earlier during that day.) One student
    in my particular group actually left after dinner on the first day.
-   I thought that a lot of the information could simply have been
    placed on the UW website for students to read[2], especially
    considering that most of the videos that were shown during the
    orientation are available on YouTube already.
-   Even though the A&O required so much time, I still felt that I
    didn't get enough time/support to register for courses. They
    allocated around 1–1.5 hours for registration, but I still felt
    rushed and actually didn't end up registering for any courses during
    the alloted time[3], mostly due to questions about prerequisites for
    majors, which math course to take, IB credits, honors courses, and
    so on. At least in the very beginning, I would have appreciated more
    extended individualized help. My wish would be that they had
    concentrated their efforts more into making sure each student got
    help instead of setting up some sort of "Husky experience" with a
    chain of presentations.[4]
-   The food/eating experience was pleasant, and much better than what I
    got during high school orientation. I appreciated the
    vegetarian/vegan accommodations.
-   The orientation leaders were extremely helpful. My particular
    orientation leader was a rising senior, so seemed to know a lot of
    things about UW. His anecdotes were rather helpful, and I was able
    to ask about e.g. taking graduate level courses and even what the
    conditions were for getting a free replacement for the Husky Card
    (in case it broke).[5]
-   I was in an honors group during the orientation, so was able to
    spend some time with peers who tended to be more high-achieving (on
    average), which perhaps helped me regarding socialization (e.g.
    having more common topics to discuss). I don't know if I was able to
    construct any "lasting friendships", but it was nonetheless pleasant
    to be in my group (of 17 people). I should mention that the
    university didn't bother to filter out students who were accepted
    into UW honors but declined; these students were forced to sit in
    for the honors presentations, and I felt bad for them.


=\=\=\=\=\
[1]\: The schedule pamphlet states "8:00am - Don't be late! Meet your
Orientation Leader at your group's designated location. Failure to
arrive on-time and check-in by 8:05am will result in a block on Autumn
course registration." In reality, they were pretty lax about this
requirement, staying until around 8:15am at the meeting spot.

[2]\: Perhaps included as part of the pre-registration screens, to force
students to read through them?

[3]\: I don't think this was usual; most people seemed to be able to get
their registration done/almost done.

[4]\: Perhaps I am being too bitter.

[5]\: I suppose one thing to keep in mind is that the orientation leaders
are paid, so they may be acting extremely helpfully to make people feel
welcomed. I personally did not mind their helpfulness/cheerfulness, and
thought they did a very good job.


# What is the dinner/lunch like at the UW freshmen A&O?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-dinner-lunch-like-at-the-UW-freshmen-A-O/answer/Issa-Rice)


From 2014:

-   Dinner (Day 1): A salad (from a huge salad bowl, so one can get an
    arbitrary amount), (canned?) oranges, some sort of stir fry (there
    was a vegetarian stir fry as well, which one could ask for at the
    kitchen), rice. We ate at the ball room in the HUB.
-   Lunch (Day 2): I think all the groups split off into different
    locations (possibly because of the problem Jennifer mentioned),
    although there were multiple groups in my location. Our group ate at
    [Local Point in Lander
    Hall](https://www.hfs.washington.edu/localpoint/), where it
    was, as Jennifer noted, a buffet-style lunch. (Vegetarian options
    were available; I had a salad and a vegetarian plate with random
    food on it.)


# What is it like to have Vipul Naik as a teacher?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-have-Vipul-Naik-as-a-teacher/answer/Issa-Rice)


I'm answering because Vipul asked me to, but I don't primarily consider him a teacher.
I first contacted him when he began Cognito Mentoring with
Jonah Sinick, so I still think of our relation as being one of
mentor–mentee.

On Quora, he helpfully answers some of my questions like [What are the common frustrations of Vipul Naik?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-common-frustrations-of-Vipul-Naik)
(which I asked because I was feeling curious after I saw one that was
asked of Alex K. Chen) and [Does Vipul Naik cook?](https://www.quora.com/Does-Vipul-Naik-cook) (which I asked because I became curious about vegetarianism/veganism).
However this is rather typical of Quora in general (e.g. I ask more questions about Alex K. Chen than about Vipul).

On Facebook, I know him as the most sedulous article collector and
discussion initiator/moderator. I suppose this is somewhat the role
teachers usually fill, by introducing material to the class. He seems to
do this better in some sense, then, by mostly bringing up discussion
topics that are of interest to me, and also by not forcing people to
contribute (which is what a traditional teacher does through verbal
remarks and grades).

He also personally tells me things e.g. to join LinkedIn or to check out
Power Smoothies, but again this applies to a greater class of people
than that of just teachers.

\

I was reminded (by Vipul) that I have also watched some of his math videos on YouTube.
I thought these were high quality, and especially interesting
since they went into more abstract topics than the typical math videos
one finds online (e.g. Khan academy).
More recently, I watched his videos on proving limits using the epsilon–delta definition (available as a playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smP5NIYsvPc&list=PLC0bHnWu122lmEcvTXAnTbb33-faiCY1E)).
I thought the videos were good, and more detailed than what my math class did in college (at the same level).
I didn't like that he already had the delta beforehand instead of using "scratch work" like many others do (although the algebraic computations do make it rather obvious what to choose for delta).
When I asked about this, he was also willing to point out a few more things, like how the choice of delta was related to the derivative of the function.
I wish he had another video explaining this, though it's understandable that at the introductory stage this sort of thing isn't discussed.


# University of Washington: Why do the computers in the undergrad astro lab only have Scientific Linux with Python 2.4?

The astro lab recently updated to Scientific Linux 6, along with Python
2.6 and Vim 7.2, so some more features may be working.

\=\=\=\=\=

**Update**: Actually if you use something like `/astro/apps6/anaconda2.0/bin/python` instead of the default installation of Python (`/usr/bin/python`), [1] then you can use Python 2.7.8 as of August 2014. The other
advantage of using the Python on Anaconda is that you get software like
[Astropy](http://www.astropy.org/)
and [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
without having to install them yourself.

[1]\: Since the astro admins install [Anaconda Scientific Python

# What was it like to attend the Seattle Quora meetup on June 27th, 2014?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-to-attend-the-Seattle-Quora-meetup-on-June-27th-2014/answer/Issa-Rice)


Some thoughts:

-   In terms of the venue, Tutta Bella had good food (although I felt
    bad for Alex K. Chen) but was a bit too noisy for conversing
    comfortably. I often found myself leaning toward whoever was
    speaking just so I could hear them.
-   It was really nice to have Hao there, because he would be able to
    give insight to things that only someone at Quora would know (e.g.
    that Quora is considering revising its "walled-garden" approach, and
    that this issue is somewhat contentious). I had been to two previous
    meet ups, and these tended to be more decentralized, but since Hao
    was there he in some sense took the role of "leader" e.g. by
    introducing himself to anyone who came later, or by managing the
    payment at the end.
-   I felt that the conversation topics were more varied, probably due
    to the higher turnout (compared to the other meetups I have been
    to). For instance there was a conversation near the end about the
    "Seattle freeze", and it was nice to see that the conversation could
    transition to even local things.
-   There were quite a few top writers there, so hearing some stories
    about the top writers' conference was fun (e.g. everyone clapping
    for Alex K. Chen before he asked a question).

# How long has Issa Rice used Linux for?

**\~5 years.**

I started with Ubuntu (either Intrepid (Oct 2008) or Jaunty (Apr 2009))
after I got my own computer (a very old Gateway machine); at first I
dual-booted with Windows XP. Even as far back as 2005/2006, however, I
remember playing around on Ubuntu (mostly just the pre-installed games)
because my father had it installed on his computer.

After a while I found [K.Mandla's blog

Using Anki for memorization is good because it incorporates both testing
(i.e. one is actively recalling information instead of just reading) and
spacing (i.e. not cramming, but rather spreading reviews out).

# As a high school student, how have you found reading and participating on Quora useful?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/As-a-high-school-student-how-have-you-found-reading-and-participating-on-Quora-useful/answer/Issa-Rice)


Some thoughts:

-   Reading about people's experiences in college has been immensely
    useful, especially since there don't seem to be other good
    systematic ways to elicit such information and make it public. Quora
    seems particularly good at spreading everything from random
    anecdotes about a teacher to general opinion about a major at a
    university to study habits, and so on. I'm also lucky that the
    school I will be attending already has a lot of questions/answers on
    Quora, so I get a "head start", in a way. See [Vipul Naik's answer to For what
    universities does Quora have the most information and
    why?](https://www.quora.com/For-what-universities-does-Quora-have-the-most-information-and-why/answer/Vipul-Naik)
    for more.
-   This is more general, but there are some amazing answers on Quora,
    which I am unsure I can find anywhere else. See e.g. [Mark Eichenlaub's answer to Do grad school
    students remember everything they were taught in college all the
    time?](https://www.quora.com/Do-grad-school-students-remember-everything-they-were-taught-in-college-all-the-time/answer/Mark-Eichenlaub)
-   Other websites I tend to be interested in (e.g. Less Wrong) are more
    intimidating, which makes contribution more difficult for high
    school students like me. Quora is more tolerant of my random
    interests. (See e.g. [Is the
    popularity of multi-colored carrots proportional to the diversity of
    ethnicities of a
    country?](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-popularity-of-multi-colored-carrots-proportional-to-the-diversity-of-ethnicities-of-a-country))
    I don't see the Stack Exchange network ever allowing me to ask that.
-   It's also probably easier to get upvotes on Quora than on Less
    Wrong, so there is perhaps more motivation to post here because of
    that.

pronounce it quite differently on here:

[Poetry Everywhere: Robert Hass Translation of Selected Haiku by Kobayashi Issa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl8pRjLSFto)

The name is taken from [Kobayashi
Issa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Issa) (and,
incidentally, has just about nothing to do with the Arabic name for
[Jesus in
Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam)). For those
interested in pronouncing it the Japanese way,
[Gemination:Japanese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geminate_consonant#Japanese)
and [Sokuon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokuon)
may also be useful.

Thank you for the A2A. (Someone has suggested to me that Jessica Su sent

# What is the longest question on Quora?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-longest-question-on-Quora/answer/Issa-Rice)

I just found [In today’s hyper-fast
business world, we watch startups like Groupon go from zero to billions
seemingly overnight.  It’s tempting to measure ourselves by these
examples and to feel wholly inadequate. Personally, I have to wonder:
Why isn’t my businesses growing as fast as these new-age juggernauts?
What am I doing wrong? Why the 'New Normal' Isn't  The truth is,
Groupon-style growth is neither normal nor sustainable, and no “normal”
company should worry about emulating it. The reason for this is
two-fold:  Without VC money to flush down the toilet, you must fund you
own growth  Your funding is mathematically limited by actual profits.
Let'stake a closer look at this simple logic. Calculating Sustainable
Growth  Normal companies are profitable, not venture-funded. Not all
businesses are venture funded (thank God), and not all entrepreneurs
want to sell their souls to a VC. Although VC money powers rapid growth,
99.9% of companies will never see a dime of VC investment.  I’m guessing
that your “normal” company is not funded by VC and instead relies on
profits to fuel growth. (Groupon, meanwhile, has burned through almost a
billion dollars of venture capital.) Profitable companies have limits...
Believe it or not, growth is naturally limited in a profitable company
that is not venture-funded. Big companies figured this out decades ago.
In fact, Hewlett Packard pioneered the term “Affordable Growth Rate” to
describe the maximum speed of growth at HP in the 1950s. HP's Affordable
Growth Rate formula is a good (and easy to calculate) method that any
profitable company can use. ...And that limit is the Affordable Growth
Rate. Your Affordable Growth Rate (AGR) is the percentage that your
sales can grow year over year. If your sales doubled, that’s 100 percent
growth – that much is simple. But sales growth is limited by your
ability to fund new sales.  So -- how fast can your business grow?
Calculate your maximum AGR by dividing this year’s net profits by last
year's equity. [More specifically, AGR = (this year’s after tax retained
profits) / (Stockholders' tangible equity at the end of last year).]
Hewlett  Packard used this equation to limit its own growth. Yes, that’s
right, they wanted to limit growth.  Why?Because growing sales faster
than the rest of your business is a sure way toget yourself into
financial trouble. HP knew that sales have to be financed(computers have
to be built, sales people paid, etc.), and financing comeseither from
your own assets (cash) or what you can borrow against those assets
(loans). Sustainable Growth Is Good Growth  There’s no magic formula for
unlimited growth in a normal company. In fact, just the opposite. Your
AGR is a rather good formula (perhaps not magic) to show why growth
should be limited. You can only grow as fast as your profits (and equity
growth) allow. Not even Groupon can change the fundamentals of
sustainable growth. (And a few rational investors have seen this in
their analysis of the Groupon IPO.) So whether you make lunch boxes or
machine tools, websites or weed-whackers, take note. Make your best
effort to grow – just be sure that the growth is sustainable by sticking
to your AGR limits. Dedicated to your (Growing!) profits,  David  By:

Some active Quora users like Alex K Chen use Quora as a **"personal web
assistant"**. See [Alex K. Chen's answer

long?](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-some-Quora-answers-so-long/answer/Alex-K-Chen)

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/Longevity-and-Life-Extension/What-can-I-do-to-live-as-long-as-possible/answer/Issa-Rice)


There is a recent (28 Feb. 2014) post on Less Wrong that discusses
longevity, which is worth checking out.

See [Lifestyle interventions to increase longevity](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jrt/lifestyle_interventions_to_increase_longevity/).
(The post is licensed CC-BY, so someone may want to attempt to extend
it.)

The comments discuss sleep apnea: [Yvain comments on Lifestyle interventions to increase longevity - Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jrt/lifestyle_interventions_to_increase_longevity/amp8).
On Quora, there is [What is it like to have sleep apnea?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-have-sleep-apnea)


# Why do Quora blogs have URLs that are subdomains and subdirectories?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Quora-blogs-have-URLs-that-are-subdomains-and-subdirectories/answer/Issa-Rice)

**For blogs with a subdomain URL**

1.  Go to the corner (on full web version) of the page with your name.
    (Hover over your name.)
2.  Click on "Create Blog".
3.  The URL will automatically assume the style http://blogname.quora.com.

Interestingly, going to either http://quora.com/yourusername/blogname or http://quora.com/blogname will redirect you to the same blog.
However the blog identifier here must be unique in all of Quora, so one does not have the freedom to choose an arbitrary name.

**For blogs with subdirectory URL**

(I actually haven't found a direct way to do this, and the current
method seems like a hack...)

1. Go to a random Quora post/answer/question.
2. Click on "Share" at the bottom of the post/answer/question.
3. Check the box that says "Post to Blog".
4. Type in any name for a blog.
5. Click on "Create Blog". (This assumes that you don't already have a
    blog with this name.)
6. Now the URL assumes the style http://quora.com/yourusername/blogname.
7. Now one can post to this blog like any other blog.
