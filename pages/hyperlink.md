# Hyperlinking effectiely

Some places to look:

- <http://www.catie.ca/sites/default/files/hyperlinking-04.pdf> (seems decent if basic)
- <http://www.digitalbusiness.gov.au/creating-your-website/creating-and-organising-content/using-hyperlinks-effectively/> (see the section near the bottom; seems to be overlap with the first link, but also has new info?)

Things to talk about:

- linking in PDFs versus HTML
- relative vs absolute links
- include examples
- linking in e.g. plaintext email, where *only* exposed links are possible
- URL shorteners?
- long exposed links appear poorly on mobile browsers
