This is my answer to the question "What is it like to take CSE 390 as part of CSE 142 at the University of Washington?"

CSE 390 was by far the most enjoyable course of the quarter.
The university doesn't seem to have strict guidelines for how professors conduct the course, so I suspect the course differs significantly depending on the professor with whom one takes the course.
I took the course fall 2014 with Stuart Reges.

# Basic structure

As Reges discussed during the first meeting, the course sessions were divided roughly in two parts: the first half would be a discussion based on a book we would read throughout the quarter (for us, it was [Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Final_Invention)), while the other half would be a discussion about a topic related to computer science chosen by Reges.

He said to the effect that during his years at Stanford, what he remembered most from his one math class was TA (or professor?) who would talk about all of the ideas that interested him---so this course is an attempt for Reges to "recreate the experience".

# The book

Barrat's book was a bit basic for me, since I had already been reading [Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com) for several years prior to the course.
The content seemed a bit repetitive, and often the arguments seemed to be based solely on Barrat's opinion (which seemed dubious, since he is apparently a documentary maker, and not an expert in AI).
Reges, as well as the class, seemed to find the content repetitive as well.
Although Reges did say that superintelligence is something we have to be concerned about, I got the impression that the class was unconvinced by the idea of a superintelligence.

# Topics that were discussed

As best as I can remember (I forgot to keep a written list), here are all the topics discussed in the second half of each session, roughly in chronological order.

- what is a meme? robert frost

- meta: which of there is more, knowledge or metaknowledge?
    - muddy children

- dunbar's number; what makes humans unique?

- card trick
    - the resourceful student who googled "reges card trick"...

- modular arithmetic and rsa encryption

- rubics cube

- automata/turing machine

- lack of American pride

- history of mathematics:
    - cantor
    - russell
    - godel
    - diagonalization

- is human communication digital or analogue?

# Other aspects

Perhaps what made the course entertaining was a number of anecdotes Reges told about famous people he had interacted with (including Peter Thiel and Stever Jobs).
