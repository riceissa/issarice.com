This page describes my relation to [Cognito Mentoring](http://cognitomentoring.org/).
I originally saw the [post on Less Wrong that Jonah Sinick made](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jee/cognito_mentoring_an_advising_service_for/), and emailed them for the first time on January 1, 2014.

I can attribute various positive changes to the advising I received from Cognito Mentoring:

- I chose to switch my intended major from pure math to computer science.
- My more than 2400 questions on Quora would not have been if I didn't find out about Quora through Cognito Mentoring.
- My continued and increased interest in the effective altruism movement.
- My decision to work on [cause prioritization]() was precipitated by discussions with [Vipul Naik](http://vipulnaik.com/).
- My decision to purchase domain names and get hosting for this site was catalyzed by [Creating your personal website](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Creating_your_personal_website) on the CM info wiki (though I already had a website using GitHub pages prior to that, and was already interested in online content creation).
- My contributions to the CM info wiki.
- My decision to join Facebook was motivated by CM.
