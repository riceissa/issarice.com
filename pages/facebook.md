I use **Facebook** regularly; [connect with me](about-me#social) on Facebook.
See "[Using Facebook effectively](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Using_Facebook_effectively)" on the Cognito Mentoring wiki.

To add to that, here is what I wrote for the Quora question "[How has the way Vipul Naik uses Facebook changed the way you think about social media?](https://www.quora.com/How-has-the-way-Vipul-Naik-uses-Facebook-changed-the-way-you-think-about-social-media/answer/Issa-Rice)":

> Vipul's bleg-style posts on Facebook have definitely opened my eyes to what's possible on Facebook. I originally joined Facebook for networking in college (as well as to join a certain discussion group), but honestly wasn't expecting too much out of Facebook (which I had thought of as a place where people post generally inane status updates). Over the six months I've been on Facebook, I've learned that as long as one is willing to curate one's Facebook feed enough, the signal-to-noise ratio can surpass that of Quora, and rival that of sites like Less Wrong. Sebastian Nickel's post praising Vipul comes to mind. To be sure, I realize that Vipul's style of posting isn't unique, but he seems to be one of the better people posting in this style.

Here is a modified version of something I wrote elsewhere:

> What I’ve learned from Vipul is that the content is only half of the story. (I mean, look at all of Andrew’s criticisms of the inane things Vipul posts—and yet Vipul is still one of the best people at Facebooking.) The other half is explicitly asking for opinions (accomplished by “T? #stl” that everyone likes to make fun of) and tagging people (often followed by facetious “expert on …” to get people to notice it). Creating the atmosphere to get people to comment is just as important as the links you post.

and:

> One thing that really made me realize the above (and also how his “stupid stuff” is different, as you say) was stalking Vipul’s timeline. Back about two years ago, he was a “regular” Facebook user as well (he posted links, but didn’t use acronyms, didn’t use “T?”, didn’t have #stl, even posted ridiculous things his students wrote on exams, etc.)—and, frankly, he was a bit boring, at least compared to present-day Vipul. (btw, that’s one of the best things about stalking people online—you get to make the same realizations they eventually made.)
