This is a collection of resources for students at the University of Washington and those considering attending there.
The page also includes some information on college in general.
Most of the resources are answers posted to [Quora](https://www.quora.com/), so having an account on there will allow you to ask for clarification in the respective answers[^anec].
The collection here may at the moment seem too “insular”, since a majority of the answers have been written by just a few people (e.g. Alex K. Chen).
This will hopefully change in the future as more people contribute their knowledge and experiences online (e.g. via Quora).

[^anec]: I have often done this and have gotten a lot of useful information.

Please [let me know](/contact) if there are any other good resources or if there are mistakes (e.g. broken links) here.
I also have a mirror of this [on Quora](https://riceissa.quora.com/Resources-for-UW), so feel free to suggest edits on there, which can then be transferred to here.
This page is also hosted on GitHub, so feel free to send corrections using pull requests.

Note that even if you’re not logged in on Quora, adding `/?share=1` to the end of the URL allows you to view *all* answers, not just the first one.

## For prefrosh

Applications for the University of Washington are accepted starting in October and until December 1 (though they may extend it for a day if their servers crash—but don't count on this).
Then, decisions are mailed starting around March 15 (and you have until around May 1 to decide whether to attend).
After that, there are several events designed to welcome prospective students and incoming freshmen.

- [How can I get the most out of a single day visit at the University of Washington?](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-get-the-most-out-of-a-single-day-visit-at-the-University-of-Washington)

### Admitted Student Previews (~April)

This event is hosted before decision day, and is designed to let prospective students decide whether they want to attend UW by walking around campus, meeting fellow admitted students, and so on.

- [University of Washington: Is it worthwhile to attend the Admitted Student Previews (undergrad) at the University of Washington?](https://www.quora.com/University-of-Washington/Is-it-worthwhile-to-attend-the-Admitted-Student-Previews-undergrad-at-the-University-of-Washington)

### Advising and Orientation session (A&O) (June–August)

This event occurs after decision day, and usually after high school is over.
It is designed to welcome incoming freshmen (i.e. people who were accepted to UW and chose to attend there) by giving tours of the campus, allowing incoming freshmen to interact with each other, having them sign up for their fall-quarter courses, and so on.

- [What is it like to go to the UW A&O (for freshmen)?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-go-to-the-UW-A-O-for-freshmen)
I have documented my own thoughts [here](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-go-to-the-UW-A-O-for-freshmen/answer/Issa-Rice) (currently the question only has my answer, so it is essentially identical to the question link) and [here](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-dinner-lunch-like-at-the-UW-freshmen-A-O/answer/Issa-Rice) (regarding the meals); see also [What is the dinner/lunch like at the UW freshmen A&O?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-dinner-lunch-like-at-the-UW-freshmen-A-O) for the meals.

Alex says, in part:

    > Make yourself **extremely** stalkable and Googleable (and clearly
    > mark that you're open to emails and random Facebook friend
    > requests from strangers). And also - archive up \*all\* the
    > interesting things you've gathered up and put them somewhere
    > that's \*ultra-accessible\*, so that they can easily find them.
    > Use the cloud as your storage space, and default most of your
    > Facebook status updates to public.

-   [How does one meet new people at UWashington?](https://www.quora.com/University-of-Washington/How-does-one-meet-new-people-at-UWashington)

    - Consider going to a Quora meet-up.
For the ones in Seattle, see [this page](http://seattlequorameetups.quora.com/). (This blog is currently closed to the public, but if you contact me and you live in the Seattle area, I can probably get you in.)

        The Seattle Quora group also has its own [Facebook group page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/quoraseattle/).  It's a closed group, but I can let you in.

    - [How do I recruit people to join Quora at the University of Washington?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-recruit-people-to-join-Quora-at-the-University-of-Washington) (all the answers seem good)

- The University of Washington does have [its own Facebook app](https://apps.facebook.com/uw_fbapp/) (maybe only for freshmen?), but I haven’t had much success with this yet.

## Housing

Unfortunately most of these questions don't have any answers yet, but they all have the potential to become useful resources in the future, so I will still put them here.

- Eventually see [What University of Washington dorm is the best to live in, and why?](https://www.quora.com/What-University-of-Washington-dorm-is-the-best-to-live-in-and-why); at the moment there aren't any answers there (2014-05-27); closely related is [Do the University of Washington dorms have personalities associated with them?](https://www.quora.com/University-of-Washington/Do-the-University-of-Washington-dorms-have-personalities-associated-with-them).

## UW Honors

<!-- internal tags: uwhons uw hons -->

-   For a comparison of UW Honors to top schools (in STEM), see the Quora question [How does the University of Washington honors program undergraduate student quality compare with that of top schools like MIT and Caltech?](https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-University-of-Washington-honors-program-undergraduate-student-quality-compare-with-that-of-top-schools-like-MIT-and-Caltech)

- [What is the Honors program at the University of Washington like? Is it worth joining?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Honors-program-at-the-University-of-Washington-like-Is-it-worth-joining)

- There are many examples of honors portfolios available [here](https://sites.google.com/a/uw.edu/the-honors-portfolio/portfolio-examples).
You may need a UW account to see some of them, though.
I'm also highly considering doing my honors portfolio on Quora, [since this seems to be possible](https://www.quora.com/University-of-Washington/Is-it-possible-to-create-ones-honors-portfolio-on-Quora); I encourage others to look into this as well so that one can reflect+fulfil the requirement+add useful content on the internet so others can access it freely, all at the same time.

- I also highly recommend contacting one or more [UW Honors peer mentors](http://depts.washington.edu/uwhonors/community/mentors/list/); they were all very responsive to email when I contacted them.

## Early entrance

## Atmospheric science

- [What is it like to study Atmospheric Science at the University of Washington?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-study-Atmospheric-Science-at-the-University-of-Washington)
In particular, Alex K. Chen says:

- [What are some downsides to doing research in atmospheric science?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-downsides-to-doing-research-in-atmospheric-science) (Alex K. Chen’s and Reena Joubert’s answers are especially good.)

## Math

- This question on Quora currently does not have extensive answers, but this may change in the future: [Why is applied math at the University of Washington top 10 in the nation while pure math is not even close to that?](https://www.quora.com/University-of-Washington/Why-is-applied-math-at-the-University-of-Washington-top-10-in-the-nation-while-pure-math-is-not-even-close-to-that)

## Thinking about graduate school

By now Quora might be the best source for information, although I'm not really knowledgeable on the subject.

- [What's the hardest part of being a PhD student?](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-hardest-part-of-being-a-PhD-student)

- [What are the best forums about graduate school?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-forums-about-graduate-school)

- The [Academia Stack Exchange](http://academia.stackexchange.com/) may also have useful information.
