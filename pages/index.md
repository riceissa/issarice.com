This is the website of Issa Rice.
This site stores basic information about myself, but it is also a personal wiki of sorts.
Below are some pages that may be of interest:

- [About me](); [contact me](./about-me#contact)
- [About this site](./about-the-site)
- [Content creation]() documents my ongoing research on the organization and dissemination of knowledge, how to effectively publish content online, and how much one can impact the world by publishing such content.
- [Resources for the University of Washington]() might be a good place to look for those who attend or want to attend the University of Washington.
- I am very slowly trying to catalog broad areas of the effective altruism movement on [Effective altruism links]().
I also maintain the [Cause Prioritization Wiki](http://causeprioritization.org).
- [Notes on computing](./tags/computing) (Linux, programming, etc.)
- [Notes on math](./tags/math)
- [My Quora answers]()
- A sample of my literary creations is available [here](./tags/literary); these should not be taken [too seriously](http://www.gwern.net/Mistakes#fiction).
- One can also view a list of [all tags used on this site](./tags/index) and a list of [all pages on this site](./all).
