This is the website of Issa Rice (riceissa on various websites).
I am a student at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA, USA.

Some pages:

- [About me](/about-me#self-introduction); [contact me](/about-me#contact)
- [About this site](/about-the-site)
- “[Resources for the University of Washington](/resources-for-the-university-of-washington)” might be a good place to look if you are interested in attending or currently attend the University of Washington
- “[Content creation: the organization and dissemination of knowledge](/content-creation-the-organization-and-dissemination-of-knowledge)” documents my ongoing research on whether publishing content online impacts the world, and how to do it effectively.
- I am very slowly trying to catalog broad areas of the effective altruism movement [here](/effective-altruism-links).
I also do work on the [cause prioritization wiki](http://causeprioritization.org).
- [Notes on Linux](/tags/linux)
- [Notes on math](/tags/math)
