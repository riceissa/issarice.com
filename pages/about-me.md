I'm currently a freshman at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA, USA.
My intended major is computer science.

My interests include effective altruism, rationality ([Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com), [Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/)), Quora (and trying to ask good questions), the unschooling movement, vegetarianism/veganism, pure math (formal logic and set theory, though my knowledge here is not very advanced at this point), the copyleft/creative commons movement, the free software movement, typography (though mostly just with LaTeX), some aspects of Japanese culture (hikikomori, for instance, or Ōe in literature), and the organization and dissemination of knowledge.

## Contact

Below are some ways to contact me, as well as the account names I use on various websites.
Feel free to contact me by emailing or messaging me (on Facebook and Quora—I may not check other sites very often), stalk me online (e.g. by following me on Quora or friending me on Facebook), and ask questions about me on Quora.

- My email address is [riceissa@gmail.com](mailto:riceissa@gmail.com).
You can also send me anonymous feedback using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AbwmuMIyzB5X7P4ysL71vGD4WnMxsCKsAZULLc0X7V0/viewform?usp=send_form) (idea from [lukeprog](http://lesswrong.com/lw/8bt/tell_me_what_you_think_of_me/) and [Gwern](http://www.gwern.net/About#anonymous-feedback)).

- My [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) profile is [here](https://www.facebook.com/riceissa).
I check Facebook regularly throughout the day.
I generally accept all friend requests that don’t appear to be spam; having a [decent profile photograph](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Using_Facebook_effectively#Profile_photograph) or at least one mutual friend will let me know that your profile is genuine.

I don’t use LinkedIn very much, but feel free to connect with me.

I might use it in the future for something more, but at the moment it is simply a scratch space for me to quickly post links and ideas.
