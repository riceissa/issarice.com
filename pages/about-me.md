I'm currently a freshman at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA, USA.
My intended major is computer science.

My interests include [effective altruism](/effective-altruism-links), rationality ([Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com), [Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/)), Quora (and trying to ask good questions), the quantified self movement, the unschooling movement, vegetarianism/veganism, pure math (formal logic and set theory, though my knowledge here is not very advanced at this point), the copyleft/creative commons movement, the free software movement, typography (though mostly just with LaTeX), some aspects of Japanese culture[^japan] (hikikomori, for instance, or Ōe in literature), and the [organization and dissemination of knowledge](/content-creation-the-organization-and-dissemination-of-knowledge).

[^japan]: I lived in Japan for six years.
You can find some locations [here](https://www.quora.com/Issa-Rice/about).

## Contact

Below are some ways to contact me, as well as the account names I use on various websites.
Feel free to connect with me through any of the means below.
I am most responsive via email, Facebook, and Quora though (I may not check other sites very often).
You can also stalk me online (e.g. by following me on Quora or Facebook, or by reading what I have on this website).
I also don't mind if you ask questions about me on Quora, though recently Quora has gotten stricter about what sorts of personal questions are allowed[^bnbr].

[^bnbr]: In general, you should be fine as long as you follow Quora's “[Be Nice, Be Respectful](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Quoras-Be-Nice-Be-Respectful-policy)” policy; it matters less whether the person about whom the question is asked is fine with it.

### General

I check Facebook regularly throughout the day.
I generally accept all friend requests that don’t appear to be spam; having a [decent profile photograph](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Using_Facebook_effectively#Profile_photograph) or at least one mutual friend will let me know that your profile is genuine.

I don’t use LinkedIn very much, but feel free to connect with me.

Feel free to connect with me as friends or romantically (or both).

I don’t use Twitter very often, and when I do it’s mostly to read what others have tweeted.
