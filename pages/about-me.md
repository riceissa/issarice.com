# Self-introduction

I am highly introverted (INTP on the [Myers–Briggs Type Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator); see “[On Types of Typologies](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/27/on-types-of-typologies/)” for more) and curious about a wide array of things, including [effective altruism]()[^ea]  and rationality ([LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com), [Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/)).

[^ea]: My favorite essays on the movement are: “[On Caring](http://lesswrong.com/lw/l30/on_caring/)”, “[Effective Altruism is a Question (not an ideology)](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/9s/effective_altruism_is_a_question_not_an_ideology/)”, and “[Efficient Charity: Do Unto Others...](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gj/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/)”; if you are new to effective altruism I recommend that you start with these.

I’m passionate about spending time on the question-and-answer site [Quora](http://quora.com) mostly by trying to ask the most interesting questions.
I think question-askers are often ignored because once a good answer to a question is produced, the answer is what gets attention, not the question that led to the answer.
For my most recent questions, see [my questions page on Quora](https://www.quora.com/Issa-Rice/questions).

I’m also highly interested in
the quantified self movement,
vegetarianism/veganism,
the free content movement (so things like copyleft and the [Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons)),
the free software movement,
typography (though mostly just with LaTeX and this website),
pure math (formal logic and set theory, though my knowledge here is not very advanced at this point),
and the [organization and dissemination of knowledge](./content-creation-the-organization-and-dissemination-of-knowledge).

I am also passionate about the unschooling movement (see [Education Reform and Disruption](https://www.quora.com/Education-Reform-and-Disruption) and [my answer](https://www.quora.com/What-would-Noam-Chomsky-think-of-unschooling/answer/Issa-Rice) to “What would Noam Chomsky think of unschooling?” on Quora for more), and occasionally contribute to the Cognito Mentoring info wiki (a resource designed to help students who are intellectually curious but are frustrated with traditional schooling); see [here](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Riceissa) for my contributions.

Ambivalence about Japan is also an important part of me[^japan]; see Nobel laureate [Ōe Kenzaburō’s speech](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1994/oe-lecture.html) on the topic.
I do like the language and its literature, and am fascinated by certain aspects of Japanese society (like [hikikomori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori) and the [decline in traditional romantic relationships](http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2013%2Foct%2F20%2Fyoung-people-japan-stopped-having-sex&date=2014-11-16)), but cannot stand (for instance) its emphasis on deference to authority, nor can I tolerate its education system.

[^japan]: I lived in Japan for six years.
You can find some locations [here](https://www.quora.com/Issa-Rice/about).

I am also currently a freshman at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle, WA, USA.
My intended major is computer science, but I’m also highly interested in mathematics and physics, and am looking into astronomy and the atmospheric sciences as well.
I am continually conscious that the most important work I can do may not yet exist as a career; as such I want to adopt “a more wary attitude where I try, at each stage, to equip myself best for the present and the immediate future while gathering knowledge and resources that will help me in the farther future” ([source](https://whatisresearch.wordpress.com/2007/08/30/to-be-set-aside/)).
At the moment I think computer science is the best option for me in terms of being versatile for the future.


# Contact

Below are some ways to contact me, as well as the account names I use on various websites.
Feel free to connect with me through any of the means below.
I am most responsive via email, Facebook, and Quora (I may not check other sites very often).
You can also stalk me online (e.g. by following me on Quora or Facebook, or by reading what I have on this website).
I also don't mind if you ask questions about me on Quora, though recently Quora has gotten stricter about what sorts of personal questions are allowed[^bnbr].

[^bnbr]: In general, you should be fine as long as you follow Quora's “[Be Nice, Be Respectful](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Quoras-Be-Nice-Be-Respectful-policy)” policy; it matters less whether the person about whom the question is asked is fine with it.
