Although I haven't spent too much time investigating all resources on effective altruism, it seems that right now, discussions are occurring in disparate places, and that coordination between these places is lacking.
It is difficult, for instance, to find all EA discussions that have taken place on giving now or later, or to find all discussions on going into finance.
The goal of this page is to *slowly* compile all discussions that have taken place about EA on particular topics.

## General/introductory discussions

- [Introduction to Effective Altruism](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/) on the new EA forum.
- [Effective altruism learning resources](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Effective_altruism_learning_resources) on the Cognito Mentoring wiki.




## EA and romance

- Vipul Naik asks, ["What are some pros and cons, from the EA perspective, of an EA giving preference to EAs in the dating market?"](https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/749858421737184/) on the EA Facebook group

- This one isn't public, but [EA sugar babies](https://www.facebook.com/vipulnaik.r/posts/10204075715149084).

## EA in universities

- I only know of [Harvard EA](http://harvardea.org/), started by [Ben Kuhn](http://www.benkuhn.net/studentgroup).

- I'm trying to see if one can be started at the University of Washington; see [this Quora question](https://www.quora.com/Who-is-interested-in-an-effective-altruism-group-club-at-the-University-of-Washington) and [this](https://www.facebook.com/john.salvatier/posts/10103444497526248) (private) Facebook post.

## EA and existential risks

- The Seattle group recently had a meetup discussion [here (event page)](https://www.facebook.com/events/258088281053725/?ref_newsfeed_story_type=regular) and [here (afterthoughts)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/221612131358071/permalink/279859415533342/)

## EA in different languages

- The most obvious step is to look at all the meetups [here](http://effective-altruism.com/meetups/) and talk to the people that go to them.

- I also asked [how people have gotten started discussing EA in different languages](https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/752043351518691/), on the EA Facebook group

## Is EA morally required?

- [Views on supererogatory acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism#Views_on_supererogatory_acts) seems to indicate that people like Peter Singer don't view EA as supererogatory.

- From experience though, at least some EAs take the view that "yes, we recognize that we're not perfect people, but at least in the possibly small ways that we want to do good in the world, we're willing to do the things that make the most difference".

## EA and animal suffering
