Although I haven't spent too much time investigating all resources on effective altruism (EA), it seems that right now, discussions are occurring in disparate places, and that coordination between these places is lacking.
It is difficult, for instance, to find all EA discussions that have taken place on giving now or later, or to find all discussions on going into finance.
The goal of this page is to *slowly* compile all discussions that have taken place about EA on particular topics.

The list is alphabetized except for the very first item.

## General/introductory discussions

- [Introduction to Effective Altruism](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/) on the new EA forum.
- [Effective altruism learning resources](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Effective_altruism_learning_resources) on the Cognito Mentoring wiki.

## Local groups

### EA in universities

- I only know of [Harvard EA](http://harvardea.org/), started by [Ben Kuhn](http://www.benkuhn.net/studentgroup).

- I'm trying to see if one can be started at the University of Washington; see [this Quora question](https://www.quora.com/Who-is-interested-in-an-effective-altruism-group-club-at-the-University-of-Washington) and [this](https://www.facebook.com/john.salvatier/posts/10103444497526248) (private) Facebook post.


## Outreach

- Potential [online course](https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/768223419900684/)?

- [Post](http://roxanneheston.com/2014/09/20/on-turning-down-requests-part-1-of-2/) by Roxanne Heston on turning down requests that are "not effective enough".
This is related to the problem of trying to attract people who are interested in altruism to become effective altruists.
[Related discussion](https://www.facebook.com/vipulnaik.r/posts/10204324324964174), though it's not public.


## Potentially risky acts

- [How can effective altruists effectively use their own deaths if they are old and have little they can do in life?](https://www.quora.com/How-can-effective-altruists-effectively-use-their-own-deaths-if-they-are-old-and-have-little-they-can-do-in-life)

- Lila Rieber on [paying people to participate in dangerous human trials](https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/768177973238562/)


## Romance

- Vipul Naik asks, ["What are some pros and cons, from the EA perspective, of an EA giving preference to EAs in the dating market?"](https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/749858421737184/) on the EA Facebook group

- This one isn't public, but [EA sugar babies](https://www.facebook.com/vipulnaik.r/posts/10204075715149084).


## Social movements

## Supererogation

- [Views on supererogatory acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism#Views_on_supererogatory_acts) seems to indicate that people like Peter Singer don't view EA as supererogatory.

- From experience though, at least some EAs take the view that "yes, we recognize that we're not perfect people, but at least in the possibly small ways that we want to do good in the world, we're willing to do the things that make the most difference".
