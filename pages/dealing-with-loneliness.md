I'm not really an EOTS, but some starting points:

- [Dealing with intellectual isolation](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Dealing_with_intellectual_isolation)

- [Methods for treating depression](http://cognitomentoring.org/blog/methods-for-treating-depression/)

- [Things That Sometimes Help If You Have Depression](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/16/things-that-sometimes-help-if-youre-depressed/)

- [Radicalizing the Romanceless](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/31/radicalizing-the-romanceless/)

- Deliberately thinking about the ratio of online:real-life friends is important; see [Transferring connections from online to real-life](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Transferring_connections_from_online_to_real-life) for more:


> After you have some experience interacting within a community online, it
> may be worth investigating whether these connections can be transferred
> to a real life (i.e. non-online) setting. For some, this type of
> transfer may be especially fruitful.

> Here are some further considerations:

> -   Obviously personal safety must be taken into account.
> -   Some of the topics discussed on this wiki, such as
>     [rationality](Rationality_learning_resources "wikilink"), [effective
>     altruism](Effective_altruism "wikilink"), and
>     [Quora](Quora "wikilink"), already have local meetup groups; see
>     [Less Wrong meetup
>     groups](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups),
>     [effective altruism
>     meetups](http://effective-altruism.com/meetups/), and [Quora
>     meetups](https://www.quora.com/Quora-Meetups). Other potentially
>     useful meetups can be found on e.g.

> -   Remember that meeting up in person will become easier once one is
>     older and can drive to meetups, live on a college campus where these
>     take place, and so on.
>     -   A corollary to this is that if you are young, going to meetups
>         will allow you to interact with older people who share your
>         interests. This can be useful for both sides; see the questions
>         ["In what ways do you think older people benefit from
>         interacting with younger people, besides feeling good about
