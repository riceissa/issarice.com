I'm not really an EOTS, but some starting points:

- [Dealing with intellectual isolation](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Dealing_with_intellectual_isolation)

- [Methods for treating depression](http://cognitomentoring.org/blog/methods-for-treating-depression/)

- [Things That Sometimes Help If You Have Depression](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/16/things-that-sometimes-help-if-youre-depressed/)

- [Radicalizing the Romanceless](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/31/radicalizing-the-romanceless/)

- Deliberately thinking about the ratio of online:real-life friends is important; see [Transferring connections from online to real-life](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Transferring_connections_from_online_to_real-life) for more:

    > After you have some experience interacting within a community online, it
    > may be worth investigating whether these connections can be transferred
    > to a real life (i.e. non-online) setting. For some, this type of
    > transfer may be especially fruitful.
    > 
    > Here are some further considerations:
    > 
    > -   Obviously personal safety must be taken into account.

    >     [rationality](Rationality_learning_resources "wikilink"), [effective
    >     altruism](Effective_altruism "wikilink"), and
    >     [Quora](Quora "wikilink"), already have local meetup groups; see
    >     [Less Wrong meetup
    >     groups](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups),
    >     [effective altruism

    >     useful meetups can be found on e.g.
    >     [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/).
    > -   Remember that meeting up in person will become easier once one is
    >     older and can drive to meetups, live on a college campus where these

    >     -   A corollary to this is that if you are young, going to meetups

- [Good Mood: The New Psychology of Overcoming Depression](http://www.juliansimon.com/writings/Good_Mood/) might be good, but I haven't taken a look at it yet.

    Bryan Caplan [writes](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/04/the_inner_life.html):

        > There's a lot in *Good Mood* that I'm tempted to criticize.
        > He barely considers genetic theories of depression, and is
        > quick to blame childhood experiences for adult unhappiness.
        > Furthermore, Simon doesn't seem to realize that "sweeping away
        > the unpleasant thoughts" can be a lot like "trying to not
        > think about pink elephants." Sometimes the harder you try not
        > to think about something, the more it keeps popping back into
        > your head; that's one of the key insights behind [exposure
        > therapy](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/11/exposure_therap.html).

    However despite this, Caplan seems to have a lot of respect for Simon.
    What Caplan says about Simon is inspiring:

        > Overall, though, Simon's personal odyssey boosts my already
        > vast admiration for him. Most depressives accomplish little
        > other than spreading their misery to the people around them.
        > Simon, in contrast, was an incredibly creative and productive
        > scholar despite his inner sorrow.
