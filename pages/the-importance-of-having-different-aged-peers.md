> My experience in this regard has mostly been online through sites like
> Quora and Facebook (and thus a very biased sample of this age range).
> Since these people are a little ahead in terms of age (but not too
> much), it has been extremely interesting to observe them to see
> (potentially) where I will be in a few years. Some of them lead rather
> eccentric lives, so observing them closely provides a certain
> vicarious form of entertainment, as well as implicit advice on what
> (not) to do. Some of them tend to be vocal, and give a lot of advice
> about what to do once I am in college. Others tend to ask me for
> opinion on various topics, which always feels somewhat peculiar, since
> I'm never sure what I'm able to offer to those who know a lot more
> than I do.

> shifted. It may be too early to say whether these interactions have
