# Introduction

In high school it is common to feel the frustration described in the introductory paragraph for [Cognito Mentoring]():

> You love learning. You spend a lot of time reading fiction or learning about science or solving math problems or all of the above. School doesn’t meet your intellectual needs. Classes often emphasize rote memorization of disjointed collections of facts. You only know a few people who you can talk about ideas with. You wish you had more, and you wish you had better perspective on what there is to learn and how best to learn it.

While the [Cognito Mentoring info wiki](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Main_Page) provides excellent general advice, here I hope to give more specialized advice; in particular, this page is tailored toward my past self, and documents advice that I wish I had gotten while I was in high school.
Therefore this page is unlikely to suit most people (since the target audience is my past self, and I tend to be unusual by most standards).
Another way to describe this page is to say it is a list of all the things that have profoundly influenced and inspired me up to this point.

Feel free to [connect with me](./about-me#contact) if you have questions or just want to talk to me; in particular, if you're in the Seattle area I can even meet up with you[^uw].

[^uw]: The University of Washington campus (Seattle) would be especially convenient for me.

# Dealing with high school

## General ideas


> "\[S\]chool \[...\] is a pathological environment. It's pathological, because it sells itself as a "place of learning" while shunning the best learning tool there is \[i.e. failure\]. In school, the worst thing you can do is fail. If you fail seriously enough, you get "held back" or, at the very least, you get branded with an F. School teaches you to loath failing, which is basically teaching you to loath learning."

- Sometimes it's good just to know that you are not the only one who is extremely frustrated with high school.
Even conventionally successful intellectuals like Noam Chomsky hated high school; see [my answer here on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-would-Noam-Chomsky-think-of-unschooling/answer/Issa-Rice), for instance.

- [Drawbacks to Formal Education](http://briantomasik.com/drawbacks-formal-education/) by Brian Tomasik.

- If you are in Washington state, seriously consider early entrance to the University of Washington.
See for instance [Alex K. Chen's review](https://www.quora.com/Reviews-of-University-of-Washington-Academy-for-Young-Scholars) on Quora.

- Looking at the resources on [Cognito Mentoring]() is a good idea.

- In general, however, it's probably best to [stay mainstream until you have demonstrated success doing unusual stuff](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Stay_mainstream_until_you_have_demonstrated_success_doing_unusual_stuff).

- One can treat the system like a constraint (CM), like a day job (Paul Graham), etc.


## Paul Graham

Entrepreneur Paul Graham writes good essays on various topics, including high school.
Even [Vipul Naik](http://vipulnaik.com) of [Cognito Mentoring]() [highly respects Paul Graham](http://openborders.info/blog/paul-graham-us-immigration-policy-high-tech-programmers/):


> I’m a great fan of [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com), essayist,
> entrepreneur, and co-founder of startup accelerator [Y Combinator](http://www.ycombinator.com) (along with his wife Jessica Livingston, whom I also admire greatly). Through Y Combinator, Graham
> has changed the startup and tech company landscape and profoundly
> affected the world. (Some Y Combinator-funded companies you’ve probably
> heard of are [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com),
> [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com), [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com),
> [Scribd](http://www.scribd.com), [Disqus](http://www.disqus.com), and
> [Stripe](http://www.stripe.com)). Graham also started [Hacker
> News](http://news.ycombinator.com), a Reddit-of-sorts for the
> programmer/startup crowd. In the world of letters, Graham is better
> known for his long-form essays that include incisive social commentary.
> If you haven’t yet read his pieces, I encourage you to [check them all
> out](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) (I particularly like [this one](http://paulgraham.com/say.html), that might be somewhat relevant
> here). He’s done more for the world than most people, including me,
> could dream of. And he knows a lot more about how the world works than I
> do.

The primary essay Graham has on frustration with high school is "[What You'll Wish You'd Known](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html)".
His "[Why Nerds are Unpopular](http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html)" may also be of interest.
Below are the parts from "Why Nerds are Unpopular" that most resonated with me:

> At the time I never tried to separate my wants and weigh them against one another. If I had, I would have seen that being smart was more important. If someone had offered me the chance to be the most popular kid in school, but only at the price of being of average intelligence (humor me here), I wouldn't have taken it.
> 
> \[...\]
> 
>I think the important thing about the real world is not that it's populated by adults, but that it's very large, and the things you do have real effects. That's what school, prison, and ladies-who-lunch all lack. The inhabitants of all those worlds are trapped in little bubbles where nothing they do can have more than a local effect. Naturally these societies degenerate into savagery. They have no function for their form to follow.
>
> \[...\]
>
>As a thirteen-year-old kid, I didn't have much more experience of the world than what I saw immediately around me. The warped little world we lived in was, I thought, *the world*. The world seemed cruel and boring, and I'm not sure which was worse.
> 
> Because I didn't fit into this world, I thought that something must be wrong with me. I didn't realize that the reason we nerds didn't fit in was that in some ways we were a step ahead. We were already thinking about the kind of things that matter in the real world, instead of spending all our time playing an exacting but mostly pointless game like the others.
> 
> We were a bit like an adult would be if he were thrust back into middle school. He wouldn't know the right clothes to wear, the right music to like, the right slang to use. He'd seem to the kids a complete alien. The thing is, he'd know enough not to care what they thought. We had no such confidence.
> 
> A lot of people seem to think it's good for smart kids to be thrown together with "normal" kids at this stage of their lives. Perhaps. But in at least some cases the reason the nerds don't fit in really is that everyone else is crazy. I remember sitting in the audience at a "pep rally" at my high school, watching as the cheerleaders threw an effigy of an opposing player into the audience to be torn to pieces. I felt like an explorer witnessing some bizarre tribal ritual. 
> 
> \[...\]
> 
> Nerds still in school should not hold their breath. Maybe one day a heavily armed force of adults will show up in helicopters to rescue you, but they probably won't be coming this month. Any immediate improvement in nerds' lives is probably going to have to come from the nerds themselves.
> 
> Merely understanding the situation they're in should make it less painful. Nerds aren't losers. They're just playing a different game, and a game much closer to the one played in the real world. Adults know this. It's hard to find successful adults now who don't claim to have been nerds in high school.
> 
> It's important for nerds to realize, too, that school is not life. School is a strange, artificial thing, half sterile and half feral. It's all-encompassing, like life, but it isn't the real thing. It's only temporary, and if you look, you can see beyond it even while you're still in it.

## Peter Thiel

From [this article](http://vator.tv/news/2014-11-22-peter-thiel-education-the-catholic-church-circa-1500) (HT Alex):

> There is something very odd about a society where the most talented
> people all get tracked towards the same elite colleges, where they end
> up studying the same small number of subjects, and going to the same
> small number of careers. And that strikes me as sort of a lack of
> diversity in our thinking about the kinds of things people should be
> doing. That's very limiting for our society as well as for those
> students.

From [this article](http://vator.tv/news/2014-12-03-is-peter-thiel-the-martin-luther-of-education) (HT Alex again):

> People thought they could only get saved by going to the Catholic church, just like people today believe that salvation involves getting a college diploma. And if you don’t  get a college diploma that you're going to go to hell.
>
> \[...\]
>
> The reform will come from outside the system and the question people
> always have is, 'What does the next education system look like? What
> will it be?' And I think, like what happened to the Catholic church
> post 1500,  I think there isn't going to be a single new institution
> that will replace it. And this, of course, was the disturbing message
> of the 16th century was, the institution wasn't going to save you. You
> have to figure out how to save yourself. And in a similar way there's
> no education institution that will save you. Young people have to
> figure it out on your own. And that is the last thing anybody wants to
> hear.

# Rationality community and resources

Since about 2007, there has been a growing community---both online and offline---based around the idea of "rationality", i.e. the idea that [one should (1) have beliefs that correspond to reality, and (2) execute actions in the real world so as to achieve one's goals](http://lesswrong.com/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/).
Learning about rationality is valuable in itself, but there is also an aspect of being in a "rationalist community" that appeals to many.

I think the best places to look are: LessWrong, gwern's site, and Slate Star Codex (a blog by Scott Alexander).
In fact, both gwern and Scott Alexander are active users of LW who chose to branch off to their own websites.

In particular, for high school students, 

## LessWrong

It is however important to emphasize that having a good fit with the community of LW may be important.
For instance, I know several intelligent people who cannot stand LW.


- find more high school-related posts.

Main page: [LessWrong]().

## gwern

[gwern](http://lesswrong.com/user/gwern/) is probably one of the most well-known users on LessWrong.
He also has a [website](http://www.gwern.net/) that has numerous essays on eveything from nootropics to Wikipedia editing.
His notion of [Long Content](http://www.gwern.net/About) is also especially inspiring: "if one holds onto every glimmer of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit like a genius himself".
For high school students especially, the essays [On Stress](http://www.gwern.net/On%20Stress) and [On Disrespect](http://www.gwern.net/On%20Disrespect) may be of interest.
His [stories](http://www.gwern.net/Notes#stories) also tend to have "lessons" (like Kafka's parables) and are entertaining to read.

I think part of the appeal of gwern is that he inspires many people because his website doesn't look like "magic"; one can agree that, given enough time, anyone can attempt what he did.

One thing that gwern does particularly well is emphasizing the importance of planning for the long term.
He expertly uses free software, URL archival tools, plain texts for his site, etc.


## Slate Star Codex

[Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/) is an excellent blog ranging in topics from romance to social justice to reactionary politics.
See the [top posts](http://slatestarcodex.com/top-posts/) for more.
He is particularly good at [steelmanning](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2012/12/the-virtue-of-steelmanning/) opponents' arguments.
He is also good at picking out useful content on Reddit.

The "[graduation speech](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/23/ssc-gives-a-graduation-speech/)" Scott gives may be of interest.
I think it's entertaining to read, and makes some good points, but ultimately doesn't do anything new.
(In other words, I think Paul Graham's essays already provide a lot of the heuristics of the argument; Scott does do a better job of linking to sources and using numbers though.)
I get the feeling that my views didn't change after reading this, though perhaps for some, reading the article will give more coherence to your ideas.
The conclusion is specifically disappointing, since it abruptly ends with "kindness is what's important".
The essay also doesn't provide much that is actionable; one is left wondering "Okay, so what do *I* do?"
(In this sense I think Cognito Mentoring does a much better job.)

Scott Alexander also has an older website called [Raikoth](http://www.raikoth.net/), which has the [The Consequentalism FAQ](http://www.raikoth.net/consequentialism.html).


# Depression

High school can be a source of depression, since it is essentially [child abuse](https://www.quora.com/Do-most-intelligent-people-have-trouble-with-the-public-school-system/answer/Marcus-Geduld).
Depression can in turn cause other problems.
I'm not really an expert on the topic, but you can read my page on [Dealing with depression]().

I also do more academic research into depression as an effective altruism cause on the [Depression page on the Cause Prioritization Wiki](http://causeprioritization.org/Depression).


# Effective altruism

[to be added later; this should be about info specifically relevant for high schoolers. for more general resources, see [here](./effective-altruism-links)]


# How to go about content creation

My main page on this is [Content creation: the organization and dissemination of knowledge](./content-creation)

See also [Maintaining your online presence](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Maintaining_your_online_presence) on the Cognito Mentoring wiki.

I think now that content creation may be one of the best ways to produce lasting value.
It's always best to think in the long term; practicing a sport, for instance, may provide short-term satisfaction, but in the long term (say, after ten years) it is difficult to say what overall effect the sport had.
(There are obviously creative ways to provide value even with a sport, e.g. by recording it and therefore providing entertainment even after one has stopped playing, or by having instilled in one a sense of discipline in maintaining one's health[^otherways].)

[^otherways]: Though with this, it's always possible *without* spending all the time on a sport.

I'm probably unusual in thinking that *in moderate amounts of each* recreational drug use is probably more useful than sports.

# Thinking about careers

- [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/)
- [Cognito Mentoring](http://cognitomentoring.org/)
- [Advice for Students on Earning to Give](http://reducing-suffering.org/advice-students-earning-give/) gives a good overview of concrete steps to take in high school and college, with an EA-bent (specifically from the view that earning to give is advisable).
- See also [Conference Call on Altruistic Career Choice](http://www.givewell.org/altruistic-career-choice) with Holden Karnofsky of GiveWell.

# Books

Books are declining in relative importance because of the internet and its plethora of blogs.
Books also tend to be old, and, more detrimentally, have a slow feedback loop (i.e. on a website, errors can be corrected quickly, whereas with books it may take years---and the corrections only appear on the new editions).
Nevertheless, some books are very much worth reading.

- Start with [Cognito Mentoring's recommendations](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Core_reading_recommendations).

Some other books to look into (I haven't read some of these):

- Dawkins's *Selfish Gene*
- Douglas Hofstadter's *Gödel, Escher, Bach*[^ey]
- Judith Harris Rich's *The Nurture Assumption* and *No Two Alike*
- *The App Generation* by Howard Gardner and Katie Davis
- *Uncharted: Big Data as a Lens on Human Culture* by Erez Aiden and Jean-Baptiste Michel
- *Hatching Twitter: a true story of money, power, friendship, and betrayal* by Nick Bilton
- *[The PayPal Wars](!w)* by Eric M. Jackson
- *[The Facebook Effect](!am)* by David Kirkpatrick


[^ey]: I personally don't like this book very much, but it is highly regarded among scientists and mathematicians.
Eliezer Yudkowsky, for one, seems to [like the book a lot](http://lesswrong.com/lw/4d/youre_calling_who_a_cult_leader/): "\ 'Gödel, Escher, Bach' by Douglas R. Hofstadter is the most awesome book that I have ever read.
If there is one book that emphasizes the tragedy of Death, it is this book, because it's terrible that so many people have died without reading it."
(Emphasis removed, since it was over the whole quote.)


# Extracurriculars

- It's very difficult to completely ignore the mainstream approach, especially if one lacks imaginative/creative approaches (I think this leads many people to think that doing sports, practicing an instrument, becoming a club leader, etc., are the best use of one's extracurricular time, or even *necessary* to enusre success in college applications, etc.)

- If one wants to attend an elite college (and there are quite a few good reasons for doing so), then following this path may be a good idea (though still, it's always importatn to distinguish oneself)

- If one lives in Washington state, then the early entrace program at UW can be a very good option.
Even if one does not enroll in this program, UW is generally accepted to be a decent school (though what you do there is most important)


# Doing something important

Richard Hamming's famous talk, "[You and Your Research](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html)" is *very* inspirational.
There is a video of the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw) (though I think reading it is better, since I don't particularly like the way he gives the talk).

Some good quotes:

> In order to get at you individually, I must talk in the first person.
> I have to get you to drop modesty and say to yourself, “**Yes, I would
> like to do first-class work.**” Our society frowns on people who set out
> to do really good work. You're not supposed to; luck is supposed to
> descend on you and you do great things by chance. Well, that's a kind
> of dumb thing to say. I say, **why shouldn't you set out to do something
> significant. You don't have to tell other people, but shouldn't you
> say to yourself, “Yes, I would like to do something significant.”**
> \[emphasis mine\]

Another:

> Another trait, it took me a while to notice. I noticed the following
> facts about people who work with the door open or the door closed. I
> notice that if you have the door to your office closed, you get more
> work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most.
> But 10 years later somehow you don't know quite know what problems are
> worth working on; all the hard work you do is sort of tangential in
> importance. He who works with the door open gets all kinds of
> interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the
> world is and what might be important. Now I cannot prove the cause and
> effect sequence because you might say, “The closed door is symbolic of
> a closed mind.” I don't know. But I can say there is a pretty good
> correlation between those who work with the doors open and those who
> ultimately do important things, although people who work with doors
> closed often work harder. Somehow they seem to work on slightly the
> wrong thing - not much, but enough that they miss fame.

And:

> I started asking, “What are the important problems of your field?” And
> after a week or so, “What important problems are you working on?” And
> after some more time I came in one day and said, “If what you are
> doing is not important, and if you don't think it is going to lead to
> something important, why are you at Bell Labs working on it?”

[Jeff Meyerson's answer to "How can I overcome the depression from being rejected by all the top tech companies I have applied to?"](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-overcome-the-depression-from-being-rejected-by-all-the-top-tech-companies-I-have-applied-to/answer/Jeff-Meyerson?share=1) is particularly good:


> **You need to build something.**
>
> Build a complicated, hulking four-month deliverable that nobody else
> commissioned and that nobody else will care about. Make a game, or model
> an elevator system, or an economic phenomenon. Put it on GitHub, but
> don't expect anyone to look at it.
>
> You will learn so much, but that's not where the most value comes from.
>
> **Building something big insulates your ego.**
>
> If you have built and shipped something cool and unique on your own,
> nobody can deny your identity as an engineer, even if you sometimes
> forget how to find all the subsets of an int array that sum to k.

# Academia

Beware of "tunnel vision" into mathematics and physics (and other STEM fields too).
In particular, while knowing about the possibilities of academia is important, *going to graduate school shouldn't be one's default route*.
As [Holden Karnofsky of GiveWell says](https://80000hours.org/2013/04/interview-with-holden-karnofsky-co-founder-of-givewell/), regarding academia, "\[p\]eople usually either completely ignore that possibility or they completely ignore every other possibility".
Also you always have to remeber quotes like "[I have known more people whose lives have been ruined by getting a Ph.D. in physics than by drugs](http://physics.wustl.edu/katz/scientist.html)".
Remember that there also exist things like [100 Reasons NOT to Go to Graduate School](http://100rsns.blogspot.com/).

- the importance of *creating things* and *having something to look back on*; take the example of Uber: on bad days, Travis Kalanick can just look at the usage chart of his company.

- [Quora](http://quora.com) has a lot of information on [Education Disruption](https://education-disruption.quora.com/).

- Although [Cognito Mentoring](http://cognitomentoring.org/) is [officially in maintenance mode](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k8q/moving_on_from_cognito_mentoring/), there is still a [wiki](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Main_Page) with a lot of useful information.
(Disclosure: I [contribute to the wiki](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Riceissa).)

- conventional intellectual heroes like Bertrand Russell, Feynman, Chomsky, etc., can be good to a certain extent, in that they show you how to stand up for something, apply critical thinking, etc.
However, compared to LW and the "new wave" of critical thinking in the 2000s/2010s, they are somewhat outdated.

- Read Roy Baumeister's "[Is There Anything Good About Men?](http://denisdutton.com/baumeister.htm)"

- In general, you should stalk the lives of the most promising entrepreneurs like Mark Zuckerberg, Travis Kalanick (see especially his failcon talk), Jeff Bezos, etc.
These people are the new wave of "most impressive people", following traditional impressive people like Feynman.
