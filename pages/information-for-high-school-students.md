title: Information for high school students
tags: school, high school, less wrong
...

The idea here is to produce a list of resources for high school students who are frustrated with school and want something better, but don't know where to begin to look.
It may be better thought of as "what I wish I had (known) when I was in high school".
Therefore this page is unlikely to suit most people (since my target audience is my past self, and I tend to be at odds with the mainstream).

Feel free to [connect with me](/about-me#contact) if you have questions or just want to talk to me (if you're in the Seattle area I can even meet up with you).


## Rationality resources

### Less Wrong

Depending on your personality fit with the community, [Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/) may be a very good place to check out.
Some posts to check out (FIXME: make this part more fluid later):

Less Wrong is also a good place to find other resources.

- Some of the best content on Less Wrong might just be pointers to other high quality resources.
“[The Best Textbooks on Every Subject](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gu/the_best_textbooks_on_every_subject/)” was the post that first got me excited about Less Wrong.
Also [References \& Resources for LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2un/references_resources_for_lesswrong/) is excellent.

- [Diseased thinking: dissolving questions about disease](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2as/diseased_thinking_dissolving_questions_about/) asks the questions "What is disease?" and considers when it is appropriate to sympathize with or prod a victim of a "disease".

- [The noncentral fallacy - the worst argument in the world?](http://lesswrong.com/lw/e95/the_noncentral_fallacy_the_worst_argument_in_the/)

- find more high school-related posts.

- books are declining in importance compared to material one can find on the internet; see “[Yes, a blog.](http://lesswrong.com/lw/33j/yes_a_blog/)”

[maybe insert a guide in here of how to effectively use LW]

### gwern

[gwern](http://lesswrong.com/user/gwern/) is probably one of the most well-known users on Less Wrong.
He also has a [website](http://www.gwern.net/) that has numerous essays on eveything from nootropics to Wikipedia editing.
His notion of [Long Content](http://www.gwern.net/About) is also especially inspiring: "if one holds onto every glimmer of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit like a genius himself".
For high school students especially, the essays [On Stress](http://www.gwern.net/On%20Stress) and [On Disrespect](http://www.gwern.net/On%20Disrespect) may be of interest.
His [stories](http://www.gwern.net/Notes#stories) also tend to have "lessons" (like Kafka's parables) and are entertaining to read.


### Slate Star Codex

[Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/) is an excellent blog ranging in topics from romance to social justice to reactionary politics.
See the [top posts](http://slatestarcodex.com/top-posts/) for more.
He is particularly good at [steelmanning](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2012/12/the-virtue-of-steelmanning/) opponents' arguments.
He is also good at picking out useful content on Reddit.

The "[graduation speech](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/23/ssc-gives-a-graduation-speech/)" Scott gives may be of interest.
I think it's entertaining to read, and makes some good points, but ultimately doesn't do anything new.
(In other words, I think Paul Graham's essays already provide a lot of the heuristics of the argument; Scott does do a better job of linking to sources and using numbers though.)
I get the feeling that my views didn't change after reading this, though perhaps for some, reading the article will give more coherence to your ideas.
The conclusion is specifically disappointing, since it abruptly ends with "kindness is what's important".
The essay also doesn't provide much that is actionable; we are left wondering "Okay, so what do *I* do?"
(In this sense I think Cognito Mentoring does a much better job.)

He also has a(n older?) website called [Raikoth](http://www.raikoth.net/), which has the [The Consequentalism FAQ](http://www.raikoth.net/consequentialism.html).

## Other

- [Quora](http://quora.com) has a lot of information on [Education Disruption](https://education-disruption.quora.com/).

- Although [Cognito Mentoring](http://cognitomentoring.org/) is [officially in maintenance mode](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k8q/moving_on_from_cognito_mentoring/), there is still a [wiki](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Main_Page) with a lot of useful information.
(Disclosure: I [contribute to the wiki](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Riceissa).)

## Frustrations

### Dealing with loneliness

Please see [here](/dealing-with-loneliness).

### Dealing with school

- [Drawbacks to Formal Education](http://briantomasik.com/drawbacks-formal-education/) by Brian Tomasik.

- If you are in Washington state, seriously consider early entrance to the University of Washington.
See for instance [Alex K. Chen's review](https://www.quora.com/Reviews-of-University-of-Washington-Academy-for-Young-Scholars) on Quora.

- Looking at the resource on Cognito Mentoring is a good idea.

- In general, it's probably best to [stay mainstream until you have demonstrated success doing unusual stuff](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Stay_mainstream_until_you_have_demonstrated_success_doing_unusual_stuff).

- Everyone should read Paul Graham's [What You'll Wish You'd Known](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html), especially those who are frustrated by school.

- Paul Graham's essay [Why Nerds are Unpopular](http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html) may be of interest.
Below are the parts the most resonated with me.

    > At the time I never tried to separate my wants and weigh them against one another. If I had, I would have seen that being smart was more important. If someone had offered me the chance to be the most popular kid in school, but only at the price of being of average intelligence (humor me here), I wouldn't have taken it.
    > 
    > \[...\]
    > 
    >I think the important thing about the real world is not that it's populated by adults, but that it's very large, and the things you do have real effects. That's what school, prison, and ladies-who-lunch all lack. The inhabitants of all those worlds are trapped in little bubbles where nothing they do can have more than a local effect. Naturally these societies degenerate into savagery. They have no function for their form to follow.
    >
    > \[...\]
    >
    >As a thirteen-year-old kid, I didn't have much more experience of the world than what I saw immediately around me. The warped little world we lived in was, I thought, *the world*. The world seemed cruel and boring, and I'm not sure which was worse.
    > 
    > Because I didn't fit into this world, I thought that something must be wrong with me. I didn't realize that the reason we nerds didn't fit in was that in some ways we were a step ahead. We were already thinking about the kind of things that matter in the real world, instead of spending all our time playing an exacting but mostly pointless game like the others.
    > 
    > We were a bit like an adult would be if he were thrust back into middle school. He wouldn't know the right clothes to wear, the right music to like, the right slang to use. He'd seem to the kids a complete alien. The thing is, he'd know enough not to care what they thought. We had no such confidence.
    > 
    > A lot of people seem to think it's good for smart kids to be thrown together with "normal" kids at this stage of their lives. Perhaps. But in at least some cases the reason the nerds don't fit in really is that everyone else is crazy. I remember sitting in the audience at a "pep rally" at my high school, watching as the cheerleaders threw an effigy of an opposing player into the audience to be torn to pieces. I felt like an explorer witnessing some bizarre tribal ritual. 
    > 
    > \[...\]
    > 
    > Nerds still in school should not hold their breath. Maybe one day a heavily armed force of adults will show up in helicopters to rescue you, but they probably won't be coming this month. Any immediate improvement in nerds' lives is probably going to have to come from the nerds themselves.
    > 
    > Merely understanding the situation they're in should make it less painful. Nerds aren't losers. They're just playing a different game, and a game much closer to the one played in the real world. Adults know this. It's hard to find successful adults now who don't claim to have been nerds in high school.
    > 
    > It's important for nerds to realize, too, that school is not life. School is a strange, artificial thing, half sterile and half feral. It's all-encompassing, like life, but it isn't the real thing. It's only temporary, and if you look, you can see beyond it even while you're still in it.

## Effective altruism

[to be added later; this should be about info specifically relevant for high schoolers. for more general resources, see [here](/effective-altruism-links)]


## How to go about content creation

My main page on this is [Content creation: the organization and dissemination of knowledge](/content-creation-the-organization-and-dissemination-of-knowledge)

See also [Maintaining your online presence](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Maintaining_your_online_presence) on the Cognito Mentoring wiki.

## Thinking about careers

- [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/)
- [Cognito Mentoring](http://cognitomentoring.org/)
- [Advice for Students on Earning to Give](http://reducing-suffering.org/advice-students-earning-give/) gives a good overview of concrete steps to take in high school and college, with an EA-bent (specifically from the view that earning to give is advisable).
- See also [Conference Call on Altruistic Career Choice](http://www.givewell.org/altruistic-career-choice) with Holden Karnofsky of GiveWell.

## Books

- Selfish Gene
- GEB (though I personally don't like it much); Eliezer Yudkowsky, for one, seems to [like the book a lot](http://lesswrong.com/lw/4d/youre_calling_who_a_cult_leader/).
