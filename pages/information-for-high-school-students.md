title: Information for high school students
tags: school, high school, less wrong
...

The idea here is to produce a list of resources for high school students who are frustrated with school and want something better, but don't know where to begin to look.
It may be better thought of as "what I wish I had (known) when I was in high school".
Therefore this page is unlikely to suit most people (since my target audience is my past self, and I tend to be at odds with the mainstream).

Feel free to [connect with me](/about-me#contact) if you have questions or just want to talk to me (if you're in the Seattle area I can even meet up with you).


## Rationality resources


### Less Wrong

Depending on your personality fit with the community, [Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/) may be a very good place to check out.
Some posts to check out (FIXME: make this part more fluid later):

Less Wrong is also a good place to find other resources.

- Some of the best content on Less Wrong might just be pointers to other high quality resources.
“[The Best Textbooks on Every Subject](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gu/the_best_textbooks_on_every_subject/)” was the post that first got me excited about Less Wrong.
Also [References \& Resources for LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2un/references_resources_for_lesswrong/) is excellent.

- [Diseased thinking: dissolving questions about disease](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2as/diseased_thinking_dissolving_questions_about/) asks the questions "What is disease?" and considers when it is appropriate to sympathize with or prod a victim of a "disease".

- [The noncentral fallacy - the worst argument in the world?](http://lesswrong.com/lw/e95/the_noncentral_fallacy_the_worst_argument_in_the/)

- find more high school-related posts.

- books are declining in importance compared to material one can find on the internet; see “[Yes, a blog.](http://lesswrong.com/lw/33j/yes_a_blog/)”

[maybe insert a guide in here of how to effectively use LW]

### gwern

- [gwern's site](http://www.gwern.net/) has numerous essays on eveything from nootropics to Wikipedia editing.
His notion of [Long Content](http://www.gwern.net/About) is also especially inspiring: "if one holds onto every glimmer of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit like a genius himself".
For high school students especially, the essays [On Stress](http://www.gwern.net/On%20Stress) and [On Disrespect](http://www.gwern.net/On%20Disrespect) may be of interest.


### Slate Star Codex

[Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/) is an excellent blog ranging in topics from romance to social justice to reactionary politics.
See the [top posts](http://slatestarcodex.com/top-posts/) for more.
He is particularly good at [steelmanning](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2012/12/the-virtue-of-steelmanning/) opponents' arguments.
He is also good at picking out useful content on Reddit.

He also has a(n older?) website called [Raikoth](http://www.raikoth.net/), which has the [The Consequentalism FAQ](http://www.raikoth.net/consequentialism.html).

## Other

- [Quora](http://quora.com) has a lot of information on [Education Disruption](https://education-disruption.quora.com/).

- Although [Cognito Mentoring](http://cognitomentoring.org/) is [officially in maintenance mode](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k8q/moving_on_from_cognito_mentoring/), there is still a [wiki](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Main_Page) with a lot of useful information.
(Disclosure: I [contribute to the wiki](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Riceissa).)

- Looking at the resource on Cognito Mentoring is a good idea.

- [Advice for Students on Earning to Give](http://reducing-suffering.org/advice-students-earning-give/) gives a good overview of concrete steps to take in high school and college, with an EA-bent (specifically from the view that earning to give is advisable).
- See also [Conference Call on Altruistic Career Choice](http://www.givewell.org/altruistic-career-choice) with Holden Karnofsky of GiveWell.

## Books

- Selfish Gene
- GEB (though I personally don't like it much); Eliezer Yudkowsky, for one, seems to [like the book a lot](http://lesswrong.com/lw/4d/youre_calling_who_a_cult_leader/).
