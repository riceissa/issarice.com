title: Information for high school students
tags: school, high school, less wrong

The idea here is to produce a list of resources for high school students who are frustrated with school and want something better, but don't know where to begin to look.
It may be better thought of as "what I wish I had (known) when I was in high school".


## Rationality resources

- Depending on your personality fit with the community, [Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/) may be a very good place to check out.
Some posts to check out (FIXME: make this part more fluid later):

    - [Diseased thinking: dissolving questions about disease](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2as/diseased_thinking_dissolving_questions_about/) asks the questions "What is disease?" and considers when it is appropriate to sympathize with or prod a victim of a "disease".

    - [The noncentral fallacy - the worst argument in the world?](http://lesswrong.com/lw/e95/the_noncentral_fallacy_the_worst_argument_in_the/)

    - find more high school-related posts.

[maybe insert a guide in here of how to effectively use LW]

- [gwern's site](http://www.gwern.net/) has numerous essays on eveything from nootropics to Wikipedia editing.
His notion of [Long Content](http://www.gwern.net/About) is also especially inspiring: "if one holds onto every glimmer of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit like a genius himself".
For high school students especially, the essays [On Stress](http://www.gwern.net/On%20Stress) and [On Disrespect](http://www.gwern.net/On%20Disrespect) may be of interest.


- [Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/) is an excellent blog ranging in topics from romance to social justice to reactionary politics.
See the [top posts](http://slatestarcodex.com/top-posts/) for more.
He is particularly good at [steelmanning](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2012/12/the-virtue-of-steelmanning/) opponents' arguments.
He is also good at picking out useful content on Reddit.

- [Quora](http://quora.com) has a lot of information on [Education Disruption](https://education-disruption.quora.com/).

- Although [Cognito Mentoring](http://cognitomentoring.org/) is [officially in maintenance mode](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k8q/moving_on_from_cognito_mentoring/), there is still a [wiki](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Main_Page) with a lot of useful information.
(Disclosure: I [contribute to the wiki](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Riceissa).)


## Dealing with loneliness

I'm not really an EOTS, but some starting points:

- [Dealing with intellectual isolation](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Dealing_with_intellectual_isolation)

- [Methods for treating depression](http://cognitomentoring.org/blog/methods-for-treating-depression/)

- [Things That Sometimes Help If You Have Depression](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/16/things-that-sometimes-help-if-youre-depressed/)

- [Radicalizing the Romanceless](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/31/radicalizing-the-romanceless/)

## Effective altruism

[to be added later]


## how to go about content creation

[maybe this deserves its own page, since it's not restricted to high school students]
