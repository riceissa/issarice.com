title: Information for high school students
tags: school, lesswrong, self-improvement
...

The idea here is to produce a list of resources for high school students who are frustrated with school and want something better, but don't know where to begin to look.
It may be better thought of as "what I wish I had (known) when I was in high school".
Therefore this page is unlikely to suit most people (since my target audience is my past self, and I tend to be at odds with the mainstream).
Another way to state the purpose of this page is: it's a list of all the things that have influenced and inspired me up to this point (this point = end of high school).

Feel free to [connect with me](/about-me#contact) if you have questions or just want to talk to me (if you're in the Seattle area I can even meet up with you).


# Rationality resources

## Less Wrong

Depending on your personality fit with the community, [Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/) may be a very good place to check out.
Some posts to check out (FIXME: make this part more fluid later):

Less Wrong is also a good place to find other resources.

- Some of the best content on Less Wrong might just be pointers to other high quality resources.
“[The Best Textbooks on Every Subject](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gu/the_best_textbooks_on_every_subject/)” was the post that first got me excited about Less Wrong.
Also [References \& Resources for LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2un/references_resources_for_lesswrong/) is excellent.

- [Diseased thinking: dissolving questions about disease](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2as/diseased_thinking_dissolving_questions_about/) asks the questions "What is disease?" and considers when it is appropriate to sympathize with or prod a victim of a "disease".

- [The noncentral fallacy - the worst argument in the world?](http://lesswrong.com/lw/e95/the_noncentral_fallacy_the_worst_argument_in_the/)

- find more high school-related posts.

- books are declining in importance compared to material one can find on the internet; see “[Yes, a blog.](http://lesswrong.com/lw/33j/yes_a_blog/)”

[maybe insert a guide in here of how to effectively use LW]

## gwern

[gwern](http://lesswrong.com/user/gwern/) is probably one of the most well-known users on Less Wrong.
He also has a [website](http://www.gwern.net/) that has numerous essays on eveything from nootropics to Wikipedia editing.
His notion of [Long Content](http://www.gwern.net/About) is also especially inspiring: "if one holds onto every glimmer of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit like a genius himself".
For high school students especially, the essays [On Stress](http://www.gwern.net/On%20Stress) and [On Disrespect](http://www.gwern.net/On%20Disrespect) may be of interest.
His [stories](http://www.gwern.net/Notes#stories) also tend to have "lessons" (like Kafka's parables) and are entertaining to read.

I think part of the appeal of gwern is that he inspires many people because his website doesn't look like "magic"; one can agree that, given enough time, anyone can attempt what he did.


## Slate Star Codex

[Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/) is an excellent blog ranging in topics from romance to social justice to reactionary politics.
See the [top posts](http://slatestarcodex.com/top-posts/) for more.
He is particularly good at [steelmanning](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2012/12/the-virtue-of-steelmanning/) opponents' arguments.
He is also good at picking out useful content on Reddit.

The "[graduation speech](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/23/ssc-gives-a-graduation-speech/)" Scott gives may be of interest.
I think it's entertaining to read, and makes some good points, but ultimately doesn't do anything new.
(In other words, I think Paul Graham's essays already provide a lot of the heuristics of the argument; Scott does do a better job of linking to sources and using numbers though.)
I get the feeling that my views didn't change after reading this, though perhaps for some, reading the article will give more coherence to your ideas.
The conclusion is specifically disappointing, since it abruptly ends with "kindness is what's important".
The essay also doesn't provide much that is actionable; we are left wondering "Okay, so what do *I* do?"
(In this sense I think Cognito Mentoring does a much better job.)

He also has a(n older?) website called [Raikoth](http://www.raikoth.net/), which has the [The Consequentalism FAQ](http://www.raikoth.net/consequentialism.html).

# Other

- [Quora](http://quora.com) has a lot of information on [Education Disruption](https://education-disruption.quora.com/).

- Although [Cognito Mentoring](http://cognitomentoring.org/) is [officially in maintenance mode](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k8q/moving_on_from_cognito_mentoring/), there is still a [wiki](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Main_Page) with a lot of useful information.
(Disclosure: I [contribute to the wiki](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Riceissa).)

# Frustrations

## Dealing with depression

Please see [here](/dealing-with-depression).

## Dealing with school

- Sometimes it's good just to know that you are not the only one who is extremely frustrated with high school.
Even conventionally successful intellectuals like Noam Chomsky hated high school; see [my answer here on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-would-Noam-Chomsky-think-of-unschooling/answer/Issa-Rice), for instance.

- [Drawbacks to Formal Education](http://briantomasik.com/drawbacks-formal-education/) by Brian Tomasik.

- If you are in Washington state, seriously consider early entrance to the University of Washington.
See for instance [Alex K. Chen's review](https://www.quora.com/Reviews-of-University-of-Washington-Academy-for-Young-Scholars) on Quora.

- Looking at the resource on Cognito Mentoring is a good idea.

- In general, it's probably best to [stay mainstream until you have demonstrated success doing unusual stuff](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Stay_mainstream_until_you_have_demonstrated_success_doing_unusual_stuff).

- Everyone should read Paul Graham's [What You'll Wish You'd Known](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html), especially those who are frustrated by school.

- Paul Graham's essay [Why Nerds are Unpopular](http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html) may be of interest.
Below are the parts the most resonated with me.

    > At the time I never tried to separate my wants and weigh them against one another. If I had, I would have seen that being smart was more important. If someone had offered me the chance to be the most popular kid in school, but only at the price of being of average intelligence (humor me here), I wouldn't have taken it.
    > 
    > \[...\]
    > 
    >I think the important thing about the real world is not that it's populated by adults, but that it's very large, and the things you do have real effects. That's what school, prison, and ladies-who-lunch all lack. The inhabitants of all those worlds are trapped in little bubbles where nothing they do can have more than a local effect. Naturally these societies degenerate into savagery. They have no function for their form to follow.
    >
    > \[...\]
    >
    >As a thirteen-year-old kid, I didn't have much more experience of the world than what I saw immediately around me. The warped little world we lived in was, I thought, *the world*. The world seemed cruel and boring, and I'm not sure which was worse.
    > 
    > Because I didn't fit into this world, I thought that something must be wrong with me. I didn't realize that the reason we nerds didn't fit in was that in some ways we were a step ahead. We were already thinking about the kind of things that matter in the real world, instead of spending all our time playing an exacting but mostly pointless game like the others.
    > 
    > We were a bit like an adult would be if he were thrust back into middle school. He wouldn't know the right clothes to wear, the right music to like, the right slang to use. He'd seem to the kids a complete alien. The thing is, he'd know enough not to care what they thought. We had no such confidence.
    > 
    > A lot of people seem to think it's good for smart kids to be thrown together with "normal" kids at this stage of their lives. Perhaps. But in at least some cases the reason the nerds don't fit in really is that everyone else is crazy. I remember sitting in the audience at a "pep rally" at my high school, watching as the cheerleaders threw an effigy of an opposing player into the audience to be torn to pieces. I felt like an explorer witnessing some bizarre tribal ritual. 
    > 
    > \[...\]
    > 
    > Nerds still in school should not hold their breath. Maybe one day a heavily armed force of adults will show up in helicopters to rescue you, but they probably won't be coming this month. Any immediate improvement in nerds' lives is probably going to have to come from the nerds themselves.
    > 
    > Merely understanding the situation they're in should make it less painful. Nerds aren't losers. They're just playing a different game, and a game much closer to the one played in the real world. Adults know this. It's hard to find successful adults now who don't claim to have been nerds in high school.
    > 
    > It's important for nerds to realize, too, that school is not life. School is a strange, artificial thing, half sterile and half feral. It's all-encompassing, like life, but it isn't the real thing. It's only temporary, and if you look, you can see beyond it even while you're still in it.

# Effective altruism

[to be added later; this should be about info specifically relevant for high schoolers. for more general resources, see [here](/effective-altruism-links)]


# How to go about content creation

My main page on this is [Content creation: the organization and dissemination of knowledge](/content-creation-the-organization-and-dissemination-of-knowledge)

See also [Maintaining your online presence](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Maintaining_your_online_presence) on the Cognito Mentoring wiki.

I think now that content creation may be one of the best ways to produce lasting value.
It's always best to think in the long term; practicing a sport, for instance, may provide short-term satisfaction, but in the long term (say, after ten years) it is difficult to say what overall effect the sport had.
(There are obviously creative ways to provide value even with a sport, e.g. by recording it and therefore providing entertainment even after one has stopped playing, or by having instilled in one a sense of discipline in maintaining one's health[^otherways].)

[^otherways]: Though with this, it's always possible *without* spending all the time on a sport.

# Thinking about careers

- [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/)
- [Cognito Mentoring](http://cognitomentoring.org/)
- [Advice for Students on Earning to Give](http://reducing-suffering.org/advice-students-earning-give/) gives a good overview of concrete steps to take in high school and college, with an EA-bent (specifically from the view that earning to give is advisable).
- See also [Conference Call on Altruistic Career Choice](http://www.givewell.org/altruistic-career-choice) with Holden Karnofsky of GiveWell.

# Books

- Selfish Gene
- GEB (though I personally don't like it much); Eliezer Yudkowsky, for one, seems to [like the book a lot](http://lesswrong.com/lw/4d/youre_calling_who_a_cult_leader/).


# Extracurriculars

- It's very difficult to completely ignore the mainstream approach, especially if one lacks imaginative/creative approaches (I think this leads many people to think that doing sports, practicing an instrument, becoming a club leader, etc., are the best use of one's extracurricular time, or even *necessary* to enusre success in college applications, etc.)

- If one wants to attend an elite college (and there are quite a few good reasons for doing so), then following this path may be a good idea (though still, it's always importatn to distinguish oneself)

- If one lives in Washington state, then the early entrace program at UW can be a very good option.
Even if one does not enroll in this program, UW is generally accepted to be a decent school (though what you do there is most important)


# Doing something important

Richard Hamming's famous talk, "[You and Your Research](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html)" is *very* inspirational.
There is a video of the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw) (though I think reading it is better, since I don't particularly like the way he gives the talk).

Some good quotes:

> In order to get at you individually, I must talk in the first person. I have to get you to drop modesty and say to yourself, “Yes, I would like to do first-class work.” Our society frowns on people who set out to do really good work. You're not supposed to; luck is supposed to descend on you and you do great things by chance. Well, that's a kind of dumb thing to say. I say, why shouldn't you set out to do something significant. You don't have to tell other people, but shouldn't you say to yourself, “Yes, I would like to do something significant.”

Another:

> Another trait, it took me a while to notice. I noticed the following facts about people who work with the door open or the door closed. I notice that if you have the door to your office closed, you get more work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most. But 10 years later somehow you don't know quite know what problems are worth working on; all the hard work you do is sort of tangential in importance. He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important. Now I cannot prove the cause and effect sequence because you might say, “The closed door is symbolic of a closed mind.” I don't know. But I can say there is a pretty good correlation between those who work with the doors open and those who ultimately do important things, although people who work with doors closed often work harder. Somehow they seem to work on slightly the wrong thing - not much, but enough that they miss fame.

And:

> I started asking, “What are the important problems of your field?” And after a week or so, “What important problems are you working on?” And after some more time I came in one day and said, “If what you are doing is not important, and if you don't think it is going to lead to something important, why are you at Bell Labs working on it?”

# Expanding your imagination

- Mencious Moldbug/neoreactionaries

- Cognito Mentoring in general

- Reading what Peter Thiel/Paul Graham/Michael O. Church/Alex K. Chen/Vipul Naik/Brian Farley/Inna Vishik say.

- Eschewing the mainstream: how to ignore implicit (and explicit) social pressures?
How to ignore for example pressure to complete homework assignments?

- Experimenting with homelessness; see gwern

- activism ends after graduation -- sam alexander

- in college: how *little* grades matter.
radical experimentation,
how *little* people remember from lectures/class,
opportunity cost of college.
