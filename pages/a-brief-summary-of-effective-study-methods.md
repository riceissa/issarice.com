Note: This is a derivative work of  Arran Stirton’s [post](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k4n/a_brief_summary_of_effective_study_methods/) on Less Wrong.
I am mirroring it here mostly to test how derivative works might function for information articles.
The original work is licensed CC-BY 3.0, so I have kept the same license (except Creative Commons seems to have a new version of the license so I have updated accordingly).
I hope to attempt to build on the article by incorporating other resources I find on studying, thus treating the original article as a base and aiming to create long-content.

**EDIT:**Reworked and moved to Main following [Gunnar\_Zarncke's
advice](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/k4n/a_brief_summary_of_effective_study_methods/aunx).
**Related to:** [Book Review: How Learning

This article is organized into three sections focusing on attention,
processing and recall respectively. The advice in each section is
roughly organised in order of usefulness, although your mileage may
vary. It's best to view this as a menu of study techniques rather than
an in depth guide. Just follow at the links provided if you wish to
learn more about any point. Links with a lettered superscript^[a]^
generally link to a part of a YouTube video while those with a numbered
superscript^[1]^ link to an article. Links without any superscript
generally link to another LessWrong page.

### Paying Attention

Attention is *very* important for learning. Where you spend it [directly
determines](http://lesswrong.com/lw/blr/attention_control_is_critical_for/)
which areas of your brain you'll develop while studying and learning new
skills.

1.  **[Split your study up into 25 minute chunks, separated by five
    minute
    breaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlU-zDU6aQ0&t=1m30s)**^[a]^
    Also known as the [Pomodoro
    Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/)^[b]^. This one is simple
    to implement but tremendously effective. It will protect you from
    attention burnout, increase your useful study-time, and help prevent
    distractions from becoming procrastination by setting up a
    [Schelling
    fence](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ase/schelling_fences_on_slippery_slopes/)
    around your breaks.
2.  **[Focus on one task at a
    time](http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/a/costs-of-multitasking.htm)**^[1]^
    Multitasking is one of the worst things you can do while studying,
    it can reduce your productivity by up to 40% and divides your
    attention up unnecessarily which will impair your ability adsorb new
    information. If social media and the internet is of a particular
    distraction to you, tools such as [Stay
    Focused](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en)
    can help you stay on track.
3.  **[Set up your study
    environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlU-zDU6aQ0&t=10m18s)**^[a]^
    Exploit [situational
    psychology](http://lesswrong.com/lw/52g/the_good_news_of_situationist_psychology/)
    by making your environment more conducive to study; identify cues
    that cause you to procrastinate, remove them if possible, and set up
    cues for studying. Mentioned in the video, a 'study lamp' can make
    an effective cue providing it is only ever used for studying.
    Additionally joining a study group can be an effective way to do
    this (a good example being the [LessWrong Study
    Hall](http://lesswrong.com/lw/juh/less_wrong_study_hall_year_1_retrospective/)).
4.  **[Choose the right
    music](http://ideas.time.com/2012/09/12/does-listening-to-music-while-working-make-you-less-productive/)**^[2]^
    There are a few rules of thumb to follow here. Avoid listening to
    music while trying to adsorb new information, though if your aural
    environment is particularly distracting then music without lyrics or
    white noise can be useful. Don't use unfamiliar music or music with
    lyrics in as this will unnecessarily tax your ability to focus.
    Music can increase productivity for mundane or well-practiced tasks
    involving low mental effort.

 

Learning Material
-----------------

Before going any further I'd advise you to watch [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O7y7XEC66M&list=PL85708E6EA236E3DB&index=3)^[c]^.
It's an excellent explanation of why just going over material isn't
enough to actually learn it and additionally dispels a few myths about
the important factors in learning.

1.  **[Understand the principles behind 'deep
    processing'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xeHh5DnCIw)**^[c]^ The
    key thing to understand here is that the more you relate a new
    concept to ones previously learned, the more likely you are to
    remember it. This is *far*more effective than learning by rote, not
    only does it improve recall but it also improves your ability to
    apply the material. A study strategy that forces you to process
    things deeply is called to as an [orienting
    task](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GrOxhYZdQ)^[c]^.
2.  **[Develop your
    metacognition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH95h36NChI&t=3m58s)**^[c]^
    Metacognition refers to your beliefs about how well you know the
    material you're studying. Overconfidence here is negatively
    correlated with academic success (see the video) and [can prevent
    you from updating on new
    material](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVtCO84MDj8)^[d]^. One of
    the reasons for this negative correlation is that overconfident
    learners spend less time on material than they should. Being sure to
    test yourself on your knowledge regularly can go a long way to
    combating this.
3.  **[Understand the difference between recognition and
    recollection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlU-zDU6aQ0&t=34m35s)**^[a]^
    Related to the previous point, a sense of recognition is one of the
    biggest causes of overconfidence when reviewing material. A good
    solution is to test yourself on your ability to recall material
    before you review it. Not only will doing so help you avoid
    mistaking recognition for recollection, but knowing what you don't
    know will help target your revision.
4.  **[Troubleshoot your
    understanding](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM95HHI4gLk&t=7m47s)**^[e]^
    In most subjects, concepts have a chain of dependencies with
    advanced concepts depending on the more fundamental ones (in
    mathematics this chain is particularly long). If you're having
    trouble understanding a new concept it is very unlikely that you're
    inherently bad at understanding that concept, rather there's a flaw
    in your understanding of the more fundamental concepts that lead up
    to it. Target your understanding of those and understanding the
    concept in question will become much easier.

 

Holding onto Information
------------------------

Once you've processed the material effectively you need to be able to
recall it efficiently. While deep processing helps you get information
into long term memory, getting it to stay there is a different matter
entirely. Memory follows what's known as the [forgetting
curve](http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/p/forgetting.htm)^[3]^.
Forgetting has not so much to do with losing the information, but rather
having trouble retrieving it – and as far as learning goes you haven't
really learned something until you can effectively retrieve the
information.

1.  **[Test yourself on
    material](http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition#background-testing-works)**^[4]^
    Practicing retrieval has a dramatic effect on your ability to recall
    information. Key to this method is ensuring your cues are
    appropriate to the way you're going to be test, so past paper
    questions tend to be best. When using flashcards it is important to
    make sure the cues require to to only recall the information, but
    process is on a deep level too.
2.  **[Make use of spaced
    repetition](http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition)**^[4]^ Spaced
    repetition is testing yourself on material over incrementally larger
    periods of time (an hour, a day, a week, a month and so on). The
    idea is to test yourself on information just as you're about to
    forget it and as it turns out, it is far more efficient than just
    blindly testing yourself on material over and over. Keeping track of
    when to review information can be a pain, fortunately there's
    [plenty of spaced
    repetition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition#Software)
    software out there to do that for you (I personally find
    [Mnemosyne](http://mnemosyne-proj.org/) is simple to implement and
    use).
3.  **[Get some
    sleep](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23589831)**^[a]^ Sleep is
    absolutely crucial for retention. If you must cram, make sure you do
    it the night before the exam, if you do things the other way round
    your memory will be considerably worse of for it. In general make
    sure you get a good nights sleep every day that you've studied. If
    you're having trouble sleeping due to spending a lot of time at a
    computer [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) might be helpful to you.
