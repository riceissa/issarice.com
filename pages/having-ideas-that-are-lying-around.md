> There is enormous inertia---a tyranny of the status quo---in private and especially governmental arrangements.
Only a crisis---actual or perceived---produces real change.
When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around.
That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable.[^friedmanquote]

Some more thoughts:

- I like to keep up a "rolling release" model for this site, so that all my latest ideas are available for people to read
- Having everything online means I can easily link to some page---say, if a relevant discussion comes up
