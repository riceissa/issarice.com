Vipul Naik:

> How would the sequence of actions look if one stepped back from the situation? How would my actions look to my future self? How would they look to my past self? How would they look to somebody who was far less privileged than I was, observing me? How would they look to a hypothetical God, if he/she existed? How would they look to somebody who held me in high esteem (a friend, mentor, mentee, or business associate)? How would they look to a person who mistrusted or disliked me and was looking for material to prove the point?
