Questions about cfar i had while working on the timeline of cfar.

* so something i'm confused about is that the two upcoming workshops are
  both in october like what is CFAR up to for the three months till
  then? http://www.rationality.org/workshops/upcoming
  and more generally what do CFAR people do in between workshops?

* What fraction of workshop attendees ask for refunds? (since cfar
  offers a full refund: "Payment plans are available, as well as
  need-based financial aid. And if you conclude the benefits to your
  happiness and effectiveness don’t recoup the investment, we’ll refund
  your money up to a year after you attend the workshop."
  http://www.rationality.org/workshops/upcoming)

  There's some discussion of the refund policy here:

* what's up with geoff anders's involvement with cfar?
  e.g. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4751584

  > I know Geoff Anders, who is teaching a few of the sessions, and he
  > is awesome.

  > I second Geoff Anders being awesome. leverageresearch.org doesn't do
  > Leverage Research (his org) justice, but there's plenty of interest
  > there anyway.

* why can't i find any negative reviews of cfar? i don't think i've seen
  all or even most of the public reviews of cfar, but it's strange that
  all of them are "glowingly positive".

* So one thing that I would *like* to cover on the CFAR timeline is when various techniques came along
  like when was "double crux" invented? when did murphyjitsu come along? etc.

* From the website http://rationality.org/ on 2017-07-12:

  """Number of workshop alumni

  909 and counting"""

  On the other hand, from the 2015 review
  http://lesswrong.com/lw/n39/why_cfar_the_view_from_2015/

  """With the help of that new outreach team, we hope to add on the order of
  1,000 new alumni in 2016, increasing our total throughput by nearly an order
  of magnitude."""

  So CFAR was trying to add 1000 new alumni in 2016 alone, and yet, in
  mid-2017, their total alumni from all years is only 909? What gives?
