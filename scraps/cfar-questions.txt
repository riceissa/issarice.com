Questions about cfar i had while working on the timeline of cfar.

* so something i'm confused about is that the two upcoming workshops are
  both in october like what is CFAR up to for the three months till
  then? http://www.rationality.org/workshops/upcoming
  and more generally what do CFAR people do in between workshops?

* What fraction of workshop attendees ask for refunds? (since cfar
  offers a full refund: "Payment plans are available, as well as
  need-based financial aid. And if you conclude the benefits to your
  happiness and effectiveness don’t recoup the investment, we’ll refund
  your money up to a year after you attend the workshop."
  http://www.rationality.org/workshops/upcoming)

  There's some discussion of the refund policy here:

* what's up with geoff anders's involvement with cfar?
  e.g. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4751584

  > I know Geoff Anders, who is teaching a few of the sessions, and he
  > is awesome.

  > I second Geoff Anders being awesome. leverageresearch.org doesn't do
  > Leverage Research (his org) justice, but there's plenty of interest
  > there anyway.

* why can't i find any negative reviews of cfar? i don't think i've seen
  all or even most of the public reviews of cfar, but it's strange that
  all of them are "glowingly positive".
