My username on Wikipedia is Riceissa.
See [my English-language contributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Riceissa) and [my Japanese-language contributions](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%89%B9%E5%88%A5:%E6%8A%95%E7%A8%BF%E8%A8%98%E9%8C%B2/Riceissa).

I've been a reader of Wikipedia for a long time, but only recently started contributing (around January 2015, but not very consistently).

Starting in late 2015 I've been doing more work on Wikipedia.
See [Vipul Naik's page on sponsored editing](http://vipulnaik.com/sponsored-wikipedia-editing/) for more information.
Also relevant is my current [bounty list](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/issa-list.mediawiki).

As of June 11, 2016, I have 1,697 edits on the English Wikipedia.

# Contributions

Here I list my main contributions.
See also [Pages created by Issa Rice](http://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultiplemonths.php?tag=Pages%20created%20by%20Issa%20Rice&language=en&allmonths=allmonths) and [Pages edited significantly but not created by Issa Rice](http://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultiplemonths.php?tag=Pages%20edited%20significantly%20but%20not%20created%20by%20Issa%20Rice&language=en&allmonths=allmonths) on Wikipedia Views.
I might not update this page often, but usually either this page or Wikipedia Views should list my major contributions.
If listed in neither place, then my contributions pages (on Wikipedia itself) are the definitive source.

- [A Plus \(aplus\.com\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Plus_(aplus.com)).
This is my biggest contribution so far.
The page was actually originally supposed to be a new article, but in
the time that I worked on it, someone else went ahead and created the
page, so it ended up being more of a merge than a fresh write.
You can still see my original version in [my user namespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Riceissa/A_Plus_%28website%29).
- I started translating the effective altruism page into Japanese;
you can see it [here](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8A%B9%E6%9E%9C%E7%9A%84%E5%88%A9%E4%BB%96%E4%B8%BB%E7%BE%A9) (it's pretty bad, and I hope someone with a
stronger command of Japanese can come along and do the rest/fix up my
mistakes).
- [Timeline of online dating services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_online_dating_services)
- Form 1040 and Form 1099
