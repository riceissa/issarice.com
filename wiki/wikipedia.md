My username on Wikipedia is
[Riceissa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Riceissa).
See [my English-language contributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Riceissa)
and [my Japanese-language contributions](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%89%B9%E5%88%A5:%E6%8A%95%E7%A8%BF%E8%A8%98%E9%8C%B2/Riceissa).

I've been a reader of Wikipedia for a long time, but only recently started contributing (around January 2015, but not very consistently).

Starting in late 2015 I've been doing more work on Wikipedia.
See [Vipul Naik's page on sponsored editing](http://vipulnaik.com/sponsored-wikipedia-editing/) for more information.
Also relevant is my current [bounty list](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/contributor-lists/issa-list.mediawiki).

As of March 2017, I have 5,919 edits on the English Wikipedia.
More detailed statistics are available using [X!'s tools](https://tools.wmflabs.org/xtools-ec/?user=Riceissa&project=en.wikipedia.org).

On March 20, 2017, I was indefinitely blocked from editing the English
Wikipedia as a "Promotion /
advertising-only account".
More information is available on the [corresponding Administrators'
noticeboard/Incidents thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive948#Riceissa).
This block was one of the results of a series of attacks on [Vipul Naik's paid
content creation project](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/).

# Contributions

Here I list my main contributions.
See
["Pages created by Issa Rice"](http://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultiplemonths.php?tag=Pages%20created%20by%20Issa%20Rice&language=en&allmonths=allmonths)
and
["Pages edited significantly but not created by Issa Rice"](http://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultiplemonths.php?tag=Pages%20edited%20significantly%20but%20not%20created%20by%20Issa%20Rice&language=en&allmonths=allmonths)
on Wikipedia Views for tabulated pageviews.
I might not update this page often, but usually either this page, Wikipedia Views, or [my payment page](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/contributor-lists/issa-list.mediawiki) (which includes not just Wikipedia pages) should list my major contributions.
If listed in none of those places, then my contributions pages (on Wikipedia itself) are the definitive source.

- [Professional consensus of economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_consensus_of_economics)
- [Open Philanthropy Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Philanthropy_Project)
- Various IRS forms:
  [Form 1040](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_1040),
  [Form 1099](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_1099),
  [Form 1099-MISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_1099-MISC),
  [Form 1096](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_1096),
  [Form W-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_W-2),
  [Form W-9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_W-9),
  [Form 990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_990)

- [Form I-140](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_I-140)

- [Triplebyte](http://deletionpedia.org/en/Triplebyte)
- [A Plus \(aplus\.com\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Plus_(aplus.com)).
The page was actually originally supposed to be a new article, but in
the time that I worked on it, someone else went ahead and created the
page, so it ended up being more of a merge than a fresh write.
You can still see my original version in [my user namespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Riceissa/A_Plus_%28website%29).
- I started translating the effective altruism page into Japanese;
you can see it at [効果的利他主義](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8A%B9%E6%9E%9C%E7%9A%84%E5%88%A9%E4%BB%96%E4%B8%BB%E7%BE%A9)
(it's pretty bad, and I hope someone with a stronger command of Japanese can
come along and do the rest/fix up my mistakes).

## Global health

Most recently, I've been doing research in global health---and in the process I've been writing several Wikipedia articles in the area.
These are:

- [Timeline of global health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_global_health) (first created by me, but now being improved by others)
- Timeline of nonprofit evaluation -- deleted, see the [version on the
  Timelines Wiki](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_nonprofit_evaluation)
- [Child survival revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_survival_revolution), a major movement in global health in the 1980s--1990s
- [Priority-setting in global health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority-setting_in_global_health)
- [Timeline of deworming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_deworming)
- [Amanda Glassman](https://github.com/riceissa/issarice.com/blob/master/external/en.wikipedia.org/Amanda_Glassman.mediawiki), a senior person at the Center for Global Development
- [International Decision Support Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Decision_Support_Initiative) (iDSI), one of the partners in the Disease Control Priorities Project
- [Voices of the Poor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voices_of_the_Poor)
- [Participatory poverty assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_poverty_assessment)
- *[The State of the World's Children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_State_of_the_World%27s_Children)*, the flagship publication of UNICEF
- [Innovative Vector Control Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovative_Vector_Control_Consortium), which is funded by the Gates Foundation
- [3 by 5 Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_by_5_Initiative), an HIV/AIDS program by WHO
- [Health systems strengthening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_systems_strengthening), a term used in global health that I wanted to investigate due to its perceived vagueness (even after writing the page, I still think the term is vague)
- [Hiroshi Nakajima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshi_Nakajima), who was Director-General at WHO; I didn't write this page but made significant improvements to it

# Quotes

[gwern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Gwern#My_error), May 2010:

> But seriously: any copyvio on Youtube is Youtube or the uploader's problem.
> Are we our brother's keeper? Our task is to make the best encyclopedia we
> can, not adhere to every crazed jot and tittle of American IP maximalism
> unless it's a genuine threat to the encyclopedia. No one has ever sued us
> over contributory infringement linking to a video site, and no on ever will;
> any effort spent dealing with an illusory threat yields equally illusory

December 2007:

> You and your ilk fetishize notability, you fetishize printed sources. You
> raise up a god of process and bow down to it, burning useful good stuff as a
> holocaust with pleasing smell to it. You dare talk about quality? You guys
> don't have the slightest clue what quality is. All you can perceive are the
> trappings that sometimes go with it.
