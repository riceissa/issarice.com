I use the username Riceissa on Wikipedia.

See my English-language contributions [here][en w c].

My biggest contribution so far has been in adding to the aplus.com
article (it was actually originally supposed to be a new article, but in
the time that I worked on it, someone else went ahead and created the
page, so it ended up being more of a merge than a fresh write). (You can still see my original version in my user namespace).

I also started translating the effective altruism page into Japanese;
you can see it [here][ja ea] (it's pretty bad, and I hope someone with a
stronger command of Japanese can come along and do the rest/fix up my
mistakes).
