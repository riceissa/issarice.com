My username on Wikipedia is Riceissa.
See [my English-language contributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Riceissa) and [my Japanese-language contributions](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%89%B9%E5%88%A5:%E6%8A%95%E7%A8%BF%E8%A8%98%E9%8C%B2/Riceissa).

I've been a reader of Wikipedia for a long time, but only recently started contributing (around January 2015, but not very consistently).

Starting in late 2015 I've been doing more work on Wikipedia.
See [Vipul Naik's page on sponsored editing](http://vipulnaik.com/sponsored-wikipedia-editing/) for more information.
Also relevant is my current [bounty list](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/contributor-lists/issa-list.mediawiki).

As of June 11, 2016, I have 1,697 edits on the English Wikipedia.

# Contributions

Here I list my main contributions.
See also [Pages created by Issa Rice](http://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultiplemonths.php?tag=Pages%20created%20by%20Issa%20Rice&language=en&allmonths=allmonths) and [Pages edited significantly but not created by Issa Rice](http://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultiplemonths.php?tag=Pages%20edited%20significantly%20but%20not%20created%20by%20Issa%20Rice&language=en&allmonths=allmonths) on Wikipedia Views.
I might not update this page often, but usually either this page or Wikipedia Views should list my major contributions.
If listed in neither place, then my contributions pages (on Wikipedia itself) are the definitive source.

- [A Plus \(aplus\.com\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Plus_(aplus.com)).
The page was actually originally supposed to be a new article, but in
the time that I worked on it, someone else went ahead and created the
page, so it ended up being more of a merge than a fresh write.
You can still see my original version in [my user namespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Riceissa/A_Plus_%28website%29).
- I started translating the effective altruism page into Japanese;
you can see it [here](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8A%B9%E6%9E%9C%E7%9A%84%E5%88%A9%E4%BB%96%E4%B8%BB%E7%BE%A9) (it's pretty bad, and I hope someone with a
stronger command of Japanese can come along and do the rest/fix up my
mistakes).

## Global health

Most recently, I've been doing research in global health---and in the process I've been writing several Wikipedia articles in the area.
These are:

- [Timeline of global health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_global_health) (first created by me, but now being improved by others)
- [Timeline of nonprofit evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_nonprofit_evaluation)
- [Timeline of deworming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_deworming)
- [Child survival revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_survival_revolution), a major movement in global health in the 1980s--1990s
- [Amanda Glassman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Glassman), a senior person at the Center for Global Development
- [International Decision Support Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Decision_Support_Initiative) (iDSI), one of the partners in the Disease Control Priorities Project
- [Voices of the Poor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voices_of_the_Poor)
- [Participatory poverty assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_poverty_assessment)
- *[The State of the World's Children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_State_of_the_World%27s_Children)*, the flagship publication of UNICEF
- [Innovative Vector Control Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovative_Vector_Control_Consortium), which is funded by the Gates Foundation
- [3 by 5 Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_by_5_Initiative), an HIV/AIDS program by WHO
- [Health systems strengthening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_systems_strengthening), a term used in global health that I wanted to investigate due to its perceived vagueness (even after writing the page, I still think the term is vague)
