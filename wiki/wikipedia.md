My username on Wikipedia is Riceissa.
See [my English-language contributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Riceissa) and [my Japanese-language contributions](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%89%B9%E5%88%A5:%E6%8A%95%E7%A8%BF%E8%A8%98%E9%8C%B2/Riceissa).

I've been a reader of Wikipedia for a long time, but only recently started contributing (around January 2015, but not very consistently).

# Contributions

Here I list my main contributions.

- [A Plus \(aplus\.com\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Plus_(aplus.com)).
This is my biggest contribution so far.
The page was actually originally supposed to be a new article, but in
the time that I worked on it, someone else went ahead and created the
page, so it ended up being more of a merge than a fresh write.
You can still see my original version in [my user namespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Riceissa/A_Plus_%28website%29).
- I started translating the effective altruism page into Japanese;
you can see it [here](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8A%B9%E6%9E%9C%E7%9A%84%E5%88%A9%E4%BB%96%E4%B8%BB%E7%BE%A9) (it's pretty bad, and I hope someone with a
stronger command of Japanese can come along and do the rest/fix up my
mistakes).
- [Timeline of online dating services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_online_dating_services)
