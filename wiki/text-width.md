When reading something continuously, it is nice to have the text width of the
page rather short, so that the reader's eyes don't have to travel too far to
find the next line.

When scanning a page, looking for information, it is nice to have the text
width *wide* so that more content fits on the page. This allows the eyes to
scan more content looking for the spot to begin reading. Otherwise the reader
has to scroll the page while also scanning with the eyes.
