I took this honors seminar in winter 2015 with Adam Blank.

Just some thoughts for now:

- Writing the Brainfuck interpreter was probably my favorite section
- The prisoner's dilemma tournament was kinda limited because it wasn't really an N-by-N grid (like in the original Axlerod competition, or the LW copycat tournament)
- The discussions weren't very useful compared to actual "hands on" activities. (The discussion topics were something like "What is intelligence?" on the first day, and a debate about Snowden's leaks)
- There were two boardgame nights---I attended the first of these.
I didn't really get much out of it though.
In general even with the small and possibly "above average" (due to favoring honors students taking the course) nature of the course, networking didn't really happen for me, though I did make a few Facebook friends.
Interacting with the students during the class sessions was enjoyable though.
