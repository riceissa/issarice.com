It seems fairly common among the rationalist/effective altruist crowd to post recurring **personal reviews** detailing what they've accomplished since the last review.
For instance:

- [gwern's review for December 2014](http://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2014/12)
- [Vipul Naik's "December 2014 in review"](http://vipulnaik.com/blog/december-2014-in-review/)
- [Peter Hurford's personal review for Octorber--December 2014](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/d9/peters_personal_review_for_octdec_2014/)

Here I want to explore some of the dimensions along which these personal reviews can differ, and to try to come up with some thoughts on "best practices" on how to conduct these.

# Dimensions/parameters

- Timespan between reviews
- Content
    - Job
    - Finances
    - Time breakdown
