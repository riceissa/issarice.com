This is my course review for English 478 at University of Washington.
I took the course in [spring 2015] with [Bojan BeliÄ‡][belic].
The course is [jointly offered] with SLAV 470, SLAV 570, CHID 498, and
LING 480. The course also has the title "What's in a language name? The
case of Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and Serbian".

I took the course because of the new [diversity requirement] at
UW. I probably would have waited until later to satisfy this
requirement, but a friend invited me to take the course with him, so I
obliged.

# Content

The course was based on a series of readings (from a course packet one
must purchase at the RAM copy center for around $20).

# Grading

The grading for the two projects in the course seemed extremely lenient;
I got a 98(?)/100 (lexical analysis) on one and 100/100 on the other
(article review). The syllabus that we used seems to indicate that there
also used to be a presentation instead of one of the papers.
