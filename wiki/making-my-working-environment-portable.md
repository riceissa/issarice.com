title: Making my working environment portable
...

Just some notes for now.

- Making configuration files for common programs (vim, etc.) available online.
- Placing more things in public/online (especially on github) so they're easily accessible.
- Dealing with "cloud software"
- Also the problem of remembering passwords when using an arbitrary computer
