title: Making my working environment portable

Just some notes for now.

  * Making configuration files for common programs (vim, etc.) available
    online.
  * Placing more things in public/online (especially on GitHub) so they're
    easily accessible.
  * Dealing with "cloud software"
  * Also the problem of remembering passwords when using an arbitrary computer
  * One problem I've had: I like to use Linux Mint for my main computer, but
    some of my old computers (which I use once in a while) have Debian, and UW
    CSE lab computers use Fedora. Dealing with different distros and versions
    of software on computers is slightly tricky (e.g. compiling documents with
    LaTeX or Pandoc could yield different output). Even dealing with Vim
    plugins is slightly tricky, since e.g. Fedora's Vim doesn't seem to have
    Python (so things like UltiSnips don't work) -- actually, I just needed to
    use the `vimx` binary.
  * Most of the time this isn't such a big deal. I have a laptop that I can
    take with me pretty much anywhere, so everything is already set up in terms
    of software (though there is still the challenge of setting up the physical
    working surface).
