Key questions:

* How do independent researchers find funding?
* How does "funding culture" differ across different domains?

# Effective altruism

* Funding is a naturally recurring topic in the effective altruism community.
* Related is an [essay contest on small-scale giving opportunities](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/16e/essay_contest_general_considerations_for/) that I am helping to run.

# Free software community

* See e.g. <https://medium.com/@nayafia>.

# Libertarianism
