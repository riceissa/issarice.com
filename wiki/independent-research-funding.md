Key questions:

* How do independent researchers find funding?
* How does "funding culture" differ across different domains?

# Effective altruism

* Funding is a naturally recurring topic in the effective altruism community.
* [Effective Altruism Foundation](https://ea-foundation.org/)
* [Effective Altruism Ventures](https://web.archive.org/web/20161016063931/http://www.eaventures.org/), which apparently does not exist anymore (as of January 2017);
  see also [its announcement post on the Effective Altruism Forum](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/fo/announcing_effective_altruism_ventures/)
* Related is an [essay contest on small-scale giving opportunities](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/16e/essay_contest_general_considerations_for/) that I am helping to run.
