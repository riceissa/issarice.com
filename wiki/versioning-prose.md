There has been a lot of thought put into versioning of software:

  * [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning)
  * [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/)
  * [Why Semantic Versioning Isn't](https://gist.github.com/jashkenas/cbd2b088e20279ae2c8e)

Software has obviously backwards-incompatible changes that can be made to it.
This makes it useful to have some sort of convention of quickly telling users
when this happens.

However, I've seen less discussion of how to version prose better.
Off the top of my head:

  * Textbooks and in general books have different "editions", and for each
    edition, the authors usually note the major differences in a foreword for
    that edition.
  * Wikipedia has no concept of versions aside from its raw edit history.
    This means the full history is given, but it's also hard to tell when some
    major change was introduced.
    Note that editors can still include an "edit summary" accompanying their
    edits, but this isn't required.
  * Some web pages have a "last modification date" or "last major revision
    date" or "last substantive revision date" or something similar.
    But it's not clear whether these mean the same things across different web
    page authors.
  * Some web pages have a "History" section.
  * Some sites, such as this one, track all changes in a revision-control
    system (e.g. Git).
    This makes the "feeling" of tracking prose somewhat similar to that of
    tracking software -- because the same tools are used for both!
