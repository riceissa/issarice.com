There has been a lot of thought put into versioning of software:

  * [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning)
  * [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/)
  * [Why Semantic Versioning Isn't](https://gist.github.com/jashkenas/cbd2b088e20279ae2c8e)

Software has obviously backwards-incompatible changes that can be made to it.
This makes it useful to have some sort of convention of quickly telling users
when this happens.
