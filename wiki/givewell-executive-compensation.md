This page reviews GiveWell's executive compensation for its two co-executive directors, Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld.

Holden and Elie's salary have continued to increase.
From 2008--2014, their salary doubled from [$60,000](http://files.givewell.org/files/ClearFund/Clear%20Fund%20Form%20990%20-%202008%20-%20personal%20donor%20info%20removed.pdf) to [$120,000](http://files.givewell.org/files/ClearFund/GiveWell%20IRS%20Form%20990%202014.pdf) according to GiveWell's Form 990.

According to [Charity Navigator's 2014 Charity CEO Compensation Study](http://www.charitynavigator.org/docs/2014_CEO_Compensation_Study.pdf) (page 3):

> Higher CEO Compensation: Northeast ($148,250), Mid-Atlantic ($141,907) and Pacific West ($125,000)

Holden and Elie's salary was $120k in 2014 (the same year the study was conducted), and they're in the "Pacific West" region, so this is below median.
However, according to [their finance spreadsheet](http://blog.givewell.org/files/GiveWell_budget_Dec_2015_%28public%29.xlsx), their salary has continued to increase since 2014 (even despite lack of inflation(?)).

At the June 2015 GiveWell board meeting, Holden and Elie [proposed a salary increase from $130,000 to $150,000](http://files.givewell.org/files/ClearFund/Meeting_2015_06_17/Attachment_G_Executive_compensation.pdf) (which was approved).
