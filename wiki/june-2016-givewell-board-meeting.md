# Summary

I present a rough transcript of the June 2016 GiveWell (Clear Fund) board
meeting and provide light commentary. Topics discussed in the meeting include:

- More details of Open Phil's split from GiveWell
- GiveWell's [staff growth][sg]
- Increase in [executive compensation][ec] (i.e. Holden's and Elie's salary)
  from $150,000 to $175,000.
- Staff compensation, and various ways (such as hiring strategy) in which
  GiveWell has matured as an organization

# Introduction

I've been interested in GiveWell board meetings for a few months, mostly because
of my general interest in GiveWell itself as an organization that looks into
topics in global health that interest me and publishes charity recommendations
and conversations in that area, and that many EAs look up to and look to for
where to direct their funding; EA in turn interests me for its proximity to the
rationality community and for its purported goal of trying to do the most good
possible. I have found that some of the board members do a good job of pushing
back on Holden and Elie -- certainly a better job of it than many public written
critiques!

However, the audio format -- though supplemented by PDF attachments -- makes
these board meetings difficult to consume. Text is also [easier to search
through and search for][beware].

The two other board meetings I have spent some time going through (together with
Vipul Naik) are the [October 2015][oct2015] one and the [March 2016][mar2016]
one, with the March 2016 one being more interesting.

My main motivations for publishing this page (i.e. beyond just consuming it
myself) are to:

- Make the board meeting content more accessible
- Bring attention to the board meetings (which are only announced on the "Newly
  published GiveWell materials" feed and not the GiveWell blog), to show that
  they contain both important and interesting information

Some other points:

- It was difficult for me to tell who is talking some of the time. I think I
  could tell the difference between Holden and Elie and all the women, but the
  male board members (e.g. Tim and Rob) were difficult to tell apart.
- I'd like to thank GiveWell for being transparent enough to release (most of)
  the audio of their board meetings. As far as I know, this is quite a rare
  thing to do for an organization (though I would love to find similar
  recordings for other organizations).

attachment PDFs.

# Rough transcript

## Reelection of board members

0:55: *Holden and Elie propose that board members reelect themselves. Done
independently through email -- other votes done during the meeting (2:30)?*

## Budget discussion

3:50: Elie: We recognize this is a tough level to engage with regarding budget.

5:48 Brigid: Expenses don't line up.

6:13: Elie: Actually May 2016 -- April 2017; higher expenses if you incorporate
the later months.

7:15: Male board member: Better understanding of staff work? Breakdown staff by
function. 38 full-time staff. And between GW and Open Phil.

8:04: Elie: 15 -- Open Phil; 15 -- GW; 8 -- operation staff (shared). 2/3
expenses Open Phil, other 1/3 for GW. We're moving toward separating the
organizations. But we haven't done that yet so it's just a rough estimate.

8:35: Male board member: No time record of this split? Is the rest (ignoring the
8) research from higher to lower?

9:25: Elie: 2 for GW outreach. The rest is research of one type or another, for
either GW or Open Phil. Including program officers to entry-level researchers.

10:00: Male board member: Interns included?

10:07: Elie: Not in the 38 head count. 9 interns during the summer; rarely
during the rest of the year.

10:30: Male board member: What's the rationale for the growth? Any benchmark to
decide how much to hire?  Is there any observable correlation between the hires
and any output/content/GW fans?

11:10: Elie: This growth is to hire is "conservative" in the sense that it is
very unlikely more than 53 people across both organizations as of June 2017.
Still feel capacity-constrained for GW; Open Phil is different. No
highly-specific staff-growth plan. A lot of uncertainty about how much staff
should grow (12:09). 12:18: Before: wanted to hire more, actively tried to add
to head-count; now: successfully hired a bunch, now uncertain about whether to
continue, and only want to do it when we have something we want to fill. Holden
adds that GW has not increased because there are fewer senior people. (13:00) A
lot of the growth is Open Phil, which we're trying to split off.

13:35: Brigid(?): From the outside, it could look questionable!

14:22: Elie: So many of the people we hired are so new that we had to put in
senior staff time to train new people. Now we're coming to the end of that so we
will revisit how and whether GW research should continue to grow.

14:55: Holden: There is a low-hanging fruit dynamic. Some really extensive
efforts that haven't resulted in any new top charities. We have ideas about how
to generate new top charities but if you want the top charities to be as good as
the current ones -- or even in the same ball-park -- it's high-risk long-term
high-energy high-intensive kind of stuff (15:28); there is a question about
whether this is worth it.

15:42: Male board member: Can you talk about the types of people you have hired?
Where do they stand? What percentile of ability/experience/pay?

16:11: Elie: Helpful to talk separately about Open Phil. For GW research, most
of the people are are entry-level, out of college. 6 months to 2 years to train.
That's the 25th to 75th percentile.

16:50: Male board member: Where do you hire from?

16:58: Elie: College grads who go to top 25 schools who are interested in
effective altruism. Same is mostly true of operations staff. Primarily entry
level generalists. We now need what we need and hope to fill (17:10). Plan to
not hire as many of that types, to hire more specific roles. Instead of hiring a
generalist to learn accounting, to hire someone who knows that (17:36).

17:58: Male board member: How many have you brought in who are not entry-level?

18:02: Elie: Very few. Open Phil has bunch of senior hires.

18:50--19:14: Male board member: How much of it is them coming to you vs you
going to them?

19:18: Elie: Hard to say, but very generally most people are interested in us,
rather than us posting on job boards, for GW.

19:33: Cari(?): Different for Open Phil.

19:38: Holden: GW is more difficult to hire for in some ways, it's got its own
style, its own mission, its own kind of intellectual way of uncovering things
and of discovering things. Open Phil feels more like a lot of the hard work goes
in on the cause selection. A lot of the most idiosyncratic things about us are
around the cause selection, and it becomes easier to say there are certain
qualifications that would prepare someone for a role here.

20:14: Female board member: Is the reason people are new is because the older
people moved on to Open Phil?

20:21: Holden: There is some of that. Transition that took place starting in
2013. Alexander, Howie, and I -- Alexander and I have done that for a while now.

21:10: Elie: Just going through our first round of turnover, where people who we
hired 3 years ago are deciding to move on. In conversations with us, doesn't
seem like good long-term fit for them. Until recently hasn't happened at all.
Surprised.

24:47: Male board member: The way I think of it, GW has a CEO and it's Elie,
Open Phil has a CEO and it's Holden. Is that accurate?

25:14: Elie: Succession planning? Think it's helpful to move through the topics
and then come back to open-ended topics.

26:00: Male board member: Where do you guys see the upper thresholds of GW/Open
Phil on headcounts?

26:23: Elie: I don't have a useful answer. It's possible GW is the same size or
smaller, or all growth happens on the outreach side. And we really don't know
right now.

27:20: Female board member: Now you have 8 months of reserves. Talk about this
in context of growth.

28:00: Elie: Best guess is GV will fund 100% of Open Phil costs. So GW-specific
funding will surpass budget needs. So in holding pattern. Since this big expense
of Open Phil is going to come off. Tried to communicate this to donors (to
29:00).

29:20: Male board member: Major econ downturn? What would happen? Singularity
starts (joke)?

29:52: Elie: We haven't done major assessment. But major backers have sufficient
assets. 30:07: If we caused the catastrophe -- the equivalent of MetaFilter but
in 2017 -- that could obviously cause us unknown damage. Holden: People need to
believe in us to support us through that kind of thing.

32:10: Male board member: Strange categories for the budget. $12k in travel?

34:28: Elie: Standard entry-level salary is $50k. We even pay people higher than
Holden and Elie, to pay market value.

34:55: Male board member: This presentation not helpful in providing meaningful
oversight. I don't feel like I'm doing my job as a board member.

35:28: Elie: It's up to you if you wanna vote now. How can we improve how we
function. I agree with what Tim is saying. I agree that you can't engage with it
in a meaningful way right now.

## Executive compensation

36:10: Elie: We should now move to exec compensation! Changed the amounts, the
rest of the document is exactly the same.

38:00: Male board member: I've always struggled looking at these figures. Should
I add the two (Holden and Elie) to look at them together? What's up with
"co-executive director"? With the impending split, should we vote for just one
executive director?

38:38: Elie: At the end of 2017, we expect 1. That's why we show CEO and COO
salaries. It seems reasonable. Data not always available.

39:38: Holden: Officially next year we should update the salary comparisons.

40:55: Holden: If doing extra work would mean only make the work higher and
we're not asking for more, we're happy to skip.

41:13: Male board member: You guys are in a funny position because you're trying
to present this as objective reality, but is this what you want?

41:32: Elie: You should look at this as what we want.

42:55: Male board member: Replacement costs of CEO might be higher than
increasing salaries (continuing operations). Succession plan?

43:26: Holden: Salary is not a major thing there.

44:18: Holden: We look at our pay, we look at what we want. We come up with a
number that feels good to us. Being more thorough would only lead to a higher
number. 44:54: We would do more thorough research if we felt it was necessary.

45:26: *Unanimous approval (after pause in recording).*

48:40: Elie: Virtually all content is backed up in multiple locations. There are
things we are willing to lose, since not absolutely catastrophic to do so.

49:30: Elie: GV check-in topics. The reason we do this is Cari is in the office.
One concern is if Cari -- a big funder -- being in the office is causing
problems. Things continue to go well; just planning to take questions.

*Audio cuts at 50:18.*

50:30: Holden: GW is not dependent on GV, even after split. More like we're
partners between Holden and Cari. Big issue if one of us left. Open Phil would
take advantage of partnership, or run in a stripped down way. 51:59: Cari and
Dustin aren't tied down, they have their own thing (GV).

52:35: Male board member: Does Open Phil plan to solicit funding other than GV?

52:37: Holden: Yes, but we're still a long way from spending Cari and Dustin's
money. We're just really trying to increase room for money moved. There's donors
I could go to (53:37) but they're not the size of GV. It would be a massive
project if I wanted to get together enough donors to be like another GV. But
eventually (54:24) we'd want to do it.

56:56: Elie: Alexander is here. (57:13) Suggestion rob had is to make
subcommittees for different topics. Board professionalization, making meetings
more efficient. Plan is to follow-up individually after the meeting.

1:01:59: Male board member: Unclear what goals I'm trying to provide as a board
member. A bunch have invested in Holden and Elie's vision. We're not spending a
lot of money on GW but sending it off to others, so less concern. What is the
goal of the board? Is it as a sounding board for the CEOs to help them in their
vision?

1:07:48: *Lots of stuff about the role of board members and "protecting the
mission" and so on.*

1:08:10: Male board member: I worry that GW momentum might stall because a lot
of where effort was most invested is being taken out (as Open Phil).

1:09:10: Elie: Most of the big donors don't know Open Phil exists, don't care it
exists. They know GW, and that's what they love about it.

1:10:10: Holden: Fine by me even if GW just gets a new charity every 10 years
and just exists and grows without doing anything totally new.

1:12:00: Elie: Bigger donors are more sophisticated and ask the sophisticated
question of "What should the resources be devoted to whatever the GiveWell
product is?". It might just take one full-time staff to maintain GW. And that's
a great outcome.

1:13:00: Holden: It's possible that GW is just a project that fulfils and
important function with a manageable amount of staff and the money moved could
keep growing more than the operating expenses keep growing, which would be
great.

1:14:14: Elie: I don't think the challenge is this newness in philanthropy as
much as a general worry or skepticism that GiveWell is doing its job if the
recommendations stay the same. Maybe there will come a time when that becomes a
problem.

1:15:00: Male board member: There are a number of things GW could do that would
be extensions of what they're doing currently.

1:15:50: Holden: I think there's a few different paths for what GW does in the
next few years. Keep doing what it's doing? Or do more advocacy, consulting, or
outreach? Or find ways to have more top charities (not Holden's favorite)?
Favorite: try to seed the next top charities. That's what we're doing with GW
experimental work.

1:16:55: GiveWell labs is dead → Open Phil.

1:17:15: Elie: GiveWell experimental: could fund startups monitoring, RCTs,
etc., but with the goal of getting a new GW top charity. Could live in Open Phil
long term.

1:23:22: Holden: Comments on which of the "four paths" for GW are best?

1:24:14: Male board member: Any competitors to GW from outside? I know there are
a few that "feed on" what GW is doing.

1:24:27: Elie: No, not really.

1:24:51: Elie, on [ImpactMatters][im]: Dean Karlan et al. have deep dives on
organizations and ask similar questions, but not as deep as GW, and not clear it
will lead to recommendations for donors.

1:25:37: Holden: Slogan on their website: "Choose a cause with your heart, then
give with your head." So it's like 31 flavors. Between Charity Navigator and
GiveWell. But they give recommendations based on what you already want.

1:27:27: Elie: Holden has been the main blogger for the past 10 years, so now
that he's working on Open Phil, getting some of the other staff to participate
in that has been challenging.

1:28:55: Elie: Non-GV money might go down because so much depends on what the
top donors are doing. 80%+ retention? But this might be under-reported.

1:29:43: Elie: GW staff compensation. For a long time it was driven by a startup
mindset. We actively recruit people who will earn less than what they could earn
elsewhere. Which worked well. But as staff matured, we did market-value
comparisons for roles that we had. Primarily the same stuff as we did for
executive compensation. That plus living cost adjustments. We'll do that this
year, but hard to see in the budget. No significant changes or lowered salary.
We're growing from explicitly expecting people to make less to being more
reasonable.

1:32:50: Elie and Holden: No reason to expect GW and Open Phil will have
separate takes on this salary thing. GW expenses could grow as we get out of
this "startup mode".

1:33:55: Elie: Very roughly in the 10%--20% range for raises.

1:34:05: Holden: People are gonna raise families in the Bay Area.
