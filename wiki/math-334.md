This is my course review for MATH 334, Advanced Calculus.
I took the course in Autumn 2015 with James Morrow (TA Will Dana).

# Content

Just follows Folland's *Advanced Calculus*.

# Homework

So far problem sets seem to take even longer than they did in MATH 13X and also seem to require greater sophistication to complete.
