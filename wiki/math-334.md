This is my course review for MATH 334, Advanced Calculus.
I took the course in Autumn 2015 with James Morrow and teaching-assistant Will Dana.

# Content

Just follows Folland's *Advanced Calculus*.

# Homework

So far problem sets seem to take even longer than they did in MATH 13X and also seem to require greater sophistication to complete.

One thing I find odd is the great difference in difficulty between the lecture and homework.
In previous math classes, the homework problems were perhaps just one step beyond what was covered in lecture.
Yet in 334, it seems like the homework problems are both more numerous (and therefore fast-paced, since there is a fixed due-date) and difficult than what is covered in lecture.

In fact another strange thing: in math 13X, the homework was due on Monday, so the lecture covered essentially what we would need for the homework that we would work on during the weekend (since everyone seemed to put it off until then anyway).
However in math 334, the homework is due on Friday, so how do we use the weekend?
Since there are so many homework problems in comparison to 13X, it's prudent to use the weekend as a "head-start"; yet if we do this, the lecture becomes just a boring reiteration of what the book already covered canonically.
Indeed, the lecture content seems *way too easy* (and yet many still seem to be asking questions), and *in no way of use in solving the homework problems*.
Yet another point here: the TA in-class session is on *Friday, after the homework is due*, and we cannot ask questions about the next homework...just...what?---All this to say that the homework routine I had built up last year is of no use this year; I'm actually still not certain how I should approach the structure imposed by 334.
