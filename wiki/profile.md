On this page I'll present my results for various personality/morality tests, sort of like what [gwern has on his site](http://www.gwern.net/Links#profile), as well as what [Vipul Naik has on his site](https://vipulnaik.com/profile/).

# Personality

## Depression Anxiety Stress Scale

Taken on 2018-02-05; [test link](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/DASS/).

[![Depression Anxiety Stress Scale](depression-anxiety-stress-scale-2018-02-05.png)](depression-anxiety-stress-scale-2018-02-05.png)

I think the results here are unusually low because I've managed to block off
most of my stressors.

On 2020-12-19, I took the test at [this link](https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/depression-anxiety-stress-dass.html) (the other test from 2018 didn't exist anymore).
My result is as follows:

> Your score on the DASS scale is as follows:
>
> Depression: 12.0 [Mild]
>
> Anxiety: 10.0 [Moderate]
>
> Stress: 8.0 [Normal]
>
> Note: Scores on each scale can run from 0 to 56.

## Nerdy Personality Attributes Scale

Taken on 2018-02-06; [test link](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/NPAS/).

## Social Intelligence Test

Taken on 2018-02-05; [test link](http://socialintelligence.labinthewild.org/mite/).

[![Social Intelligence

I should note that I took this test sometime around 2013--2014. I don't
remember what I got or if I still have the results.

## Systemising Quotient

Taken on 2018-02-06; [test link](https://www.aspietests.org/sq/index.php).

[![Systemising
Quotient](systemising-quotient-2018-02-06.png)](systemising-quotient-2018-02-06.png)

I think my score for this one is unusually low for two reasons: (1) I'm not
very systemizing about things like plants, animals, and airplanes (I'm more
systemizing about things like ideas and websites); (2) I tended to answer that
I have difficulty understanding e.g. maps and diagrams because I think they are
often poorly produced.

## IQ

I took the test at <http://www.iqtest.dk/> on 2018-02-06 and got a score of 112.
For context on this number, see [this explanation](http://web.archive.org/web/20170808022516/https://www.gwern.net/Links#iq) by gwern.

I took the test at <https://www.mensa.lu/en/mensa/online-iq-test/online-iq-test.html>
on 2020-07-12 and got a score of 28/33.

## Myers–Briggs Type Indicator

I seem to consistently test out as INTP, though I'm only heavily biased in the "I" part of the personality type and the "NTP" part is more intermediate.
(TODO: find actual test results.)

The MBTI is often mocked as “unscientific”, but I think
it can be quite useful; see “[On Types of Typologies]” for more.

## Dungeons & Dragons alignment type

I got chaotic neutral when I took [the test](http://easydamus.com/alignmenttest.html) on or around 2014-09-07.
This was originally for [a Quora answer](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-Dungeons-Dragons-alignment-types-of-prominent-Quora-users/answer/Issa-Rice).

> **Detailed Results:**
> 
> ```
> Alignment:
> Lawful Good ----- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (15)
> Neutral Good ---- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (16)
> Chaotic Good ---- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (20)
> Lawful Neutral -- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (19)
> True Neutral ---- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (20)
> Chaotic Neutral - XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (24)
> Lawful Evil ----- XXXXXXX (7)
> Neutral Evil ---- XXXXXXXX (8)
> Chaotic Evil ---- XXXXXXXXXXXX (12)
> 
> Law & Chaos:
> Law ----- XXXXXX (6)
> Neutral - XXXXXXX (7)
> Chaos --- XXXXXXXXXXX (11)
> 
> Good & Evil:
> Good ---- XXXXXXXXX (9)
> Neutral - XXXXXXXXXXXXX (13)
> Evil ---- X (1)
> ```

## The Robot Test

On 2020-08-07 I took [The Robot Test](https://arfer.net/games/robot-test).
My result was as follows:

> Your total: 78 \
> Your class: Cyborg

The description for Cyborg is "You are a sorry amalgam of robot and regular
human. You linger in two worlds at once, an outsider to both the normies and
the robots. As a result, you may be on your own with your feels."

## Schizotypy Personality Scale

On 2020-08-09 I took [this test](https://www.insideprison.com/article_assessments_Schizotypal_Personality_Scale.asp) about Schizotypy Personality Scale (STA). My result is as follows:

> Your score on the Schizotypy Personality Scale (STA) (NPI) is: 11
>
> Scores of 11 usually indicate no evidence of schizotypy. At least 90% of
> test-takers score in this range or lower.

## Wisconsin Card Sorting Test

On 2020-12-19, I took [this test](https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_wcst.html), which is an implementation of the [Wisconsin Card Sorting Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Card_Sorting_Test).
My result is as follows:

> Feedback on your WCST performance \
> (Note: There were in total 60 trials)
>
> Error count: 8 (13%) \
> Perseveration error count: 6 (10%) \
> Non-perseveration error count: 2 (3%)

## Highly Sensitive Person test

On 2021-05-18 I took [this test](https://hsperson.com/test/highly-sensitive-test/), after seeing it linked by Brian Tomasik.
It is an implementation of Elaine N. Aron's (1996) highly sensitive person test.
I scored 19.

# Morals

[to be added]

# Politics

According to [The Political Compass](https://www.politicalcompass.org/) (taken 2015-08-24) I am:

> Economic Left/Right: 1.25 
> Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -6.0

Many of the question statements came across as odd to me, because of the way qualifiers were used.
For instance many statements used "some" to qualify statements, so that even if I believed the stereotypically libertarian position I would give the authoritarian-seeming answer.
