On this page I'll present my results for various personality/morality tests, sort of like what [gwern has on his site](http://www.gwern.net/Links#profile).

# Personality

## Dungeons & Dragons alignment type

I got chaotic neutral when I took [the test](http://easydamus.com/alignmenttest.html) on or around 2014-09-07.
This was originally for [a Quora answer](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-Dungeons-Dragons-alignment-types-of-prominent-Quora-users/answer/Issa-Rice).

# Morals

[to be added]

# Politics

According to [The Political Compass](https://www.politicalcompass.org/) (taken 2015-08-24) I am:

> Economic Left/Right: 1.25 
> Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -6.0

Many of the question statements came across as odd to me, because of the way qualifiers were used.
For instance many statements used "some" to qualify statements, so that even if I believed the stereotypically libertarian position I would give the authoritarian-seeming answer.
