*Below I give my personal experience attending the Seattle Japanese
School. This was originally intended as a response to [this Quora
question][q_japan], but Quora's browser-based editor was too limiting so
I've decided to publish it here.*

It's an interesting place, and culturally fascinating, but I think
experience varies a lot depending on a variety of factors (like how well
you like your local American school[^trend], the education system in general,
your affinity with Japan, and so on). For myself, overall, I liked some
of the people there a lot, but didn't really like the way things were
run or taught.

[^trend]: The general trend is, the less you like US public schools, the
more you come to "rely on" the Japanese school for making friends,
cultural identity, and so forth.

    For instance, I've heard several stories of Japanese kids who
    couldn't get along with anyone in US schools, who became severely
    depressed and even threatened violence, etc.  These kids,
    driven by their anti-Americanism, tend to feel more culturally
    affiliated to Japan and thus more at place at the Japanese school.

I attended the Seattle Japanese School from 6th grade (小 6) to 12th (高
3), graduating all of elementary, junior high, and high schools (it's
all run by the same people, so the division is nominal). I had actually
arrived in the US in time to attend the school starting from 4th grade,
but my parents didn't want to enroll me then; they wanted me to
assimilate to the US first. The assimilation was actually very
successful, because by the time my parents decided to enroll me at the
Japanese school in 6th grade, my English was good enough to stop going
to the [English-language learner](!w) program at my public US elementary
school (I actually had stopped going after exactly one year), but also
my Japanese had deteriorated to such an extent that I actually failed
the Japanese school's entrance examination!

Following such a humiliating failure, my Japanese mother decided to
purchase official Japanese language and mathematics (because there are
"Japanese ways" to solve math problems) textbooks from Japan to cover
the material of 4th and 5th grade. I spent around two months rapidly
going through these books, both with my mother and a (grown) Japanese
friend who had come to visit the US. The studying paid off, for on the
second try I was admitted. (This was not without additional caveats
though: the Japanese school year begins in April, but because of the
delay in admission caused by the period of self-study, I was only
admitted in May, missing the first month of classes for that school
year.)

Most of 6th grade was spent alone. I didn't really talk to anyone, nor
did I make friends. I was invited to one birthday party, but I suspect
this was simply a gesture (though I did attend)[^friend]. This wasn't really
worse than what I was going through in US public elementary school
though (I also had basically no friends there—none that I would hang out
with out of school, anyway[^birthday]). Toward the end of the year, we read [Kenji
Miyazawa](!w)'s "Yamanashi" ("[やまなし](!wja)"), which changed things around: the
class got into a huge discussion about the true nature of the mysterious
kuramubon (クラムボン) that is mentioned in the story. Myself and
another boy became the most vocal supporters for one of the positions,
and this almost "tribal" affiliation developed into friendship (that is
still maintained somewhat today). After that, I began talking to more
people in class in general, so the school became more enjoyable.

7th grade (中 1) marks the start of junior high, and classes were now
conducted at [Interlake High School](!w) instead of [Odle Middle
School](!w). This was also the year when the "cherry blossom" and
"rhododendron" cohorts merged[^sakura], so the resulting dynamic was
amusing to observe. This was also the year when I first started to
really hang out with friends outside of school, mostly by playing video
games. In September, the school moved to [Sammamish High School](!w).
Fall is also when the annual "sports festival" (スポーツ大会) takes
place; it is actually just a day-long volleyball tournament (for junior
high and high school students). As expected, being the youngest ones to
be participating, the teams in our grade all failed miserably. One
significant thing that happened on this day though: a few of my friends
got together to hang out after the tournament, and we all went to my
house to play video games and socialize. This actually resulted in my
first all-nighter with friends, and continues to be one of my fondest
memories.

[^sakura]: The Japanese school used to have a system (that it has since
discontinued) where during
elementary school, the children would be separated into two groups
depending on a few factors, like whether the child was expecting to
return to Japan and their level of Japanese fluency; the "cherry
blossoms", or 桜, were the ones with more Japanese fluency, while the
"rhododendrons" or シャクナゲ, were considered the more "Americanized"
ones, who were almost tacitly assumed to quit after elementary school …

In many ways, a lot of the later years sort of blur together, because
everything happened at Sammamish high school (so no locational
distinction to aid my memory), and my friend group also stayed
essentially constant.  There are a few memories that stand out though,
which I suppose I should relate.

- 8th grade geometry
- math in upper level high school (teacher's attempt at teaching
  calculus of variations, etc.)

more thoughts:

- a lot of useless work; i actually learned more japanese in my final
  two years or so of intensely reading japanese literature than from
  language class.
- how friend group consisted almost entirely of half-japanese half-white
  males...
- not too difficult to be the top of the class, since most ppl don't
  even do any hw, nor do they pay much attention in class.
- *extremely* tedious mandatory assemblies that were *much* worse than
  in US schools
- especially in high school, it become very obvious that a lot of the
  kids were just attending the school to socialize+have something they
  could write on in their college apps.

[^friend]: Strangely enough, this person ended up being one of my closest friends at the Japanese school.

[^birthday]: I was *also* invited to just one birthday party there!
