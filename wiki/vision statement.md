Prompts:

- if i were to die today, what document could i leave that would allow people to implement the vision i had while i was still alive?
- what document could i write right now that would minimize the differences between (1) a world a thousand years from now in which i remain alive for all of those 1000 years, and (2) a world a thousand years from now but one where i disappeared from it tomorrow?
- if i could suddenly have a million assistants who were like at the competence level of freshly-graduated college students (or something), what instructions can i give them right now that would speed up progress on what i'd like to see in the world at least as much as a world in which a million versions of me existed?

i feel like i _do_ a lot of things in the world in a way that makes complete sense to me but where people who observe just my actions without talking to me don't really know why i did a thing. so here i try to explain things -- why i do things at all, how i pick which things to do, etc, while also keeping in mind the prompts i listed above.

WARNING TO SELF: this document will probably not work. just look at all of those foundations where a rich dude left a bunch of money and told people to do things, and then those foundations ended up doing totally different things after a hundred years. but let's try; maybe by having past examples of failures, or just more thoughtfulness (how hard did these dudes try, anyway?), i can do a little bit better.
