title: Is effective altruism new?

*Note: this is a draft. The claims here have not been stress-tested, so
plausibly could turn out to be misguided. The general thrust seems right to me
(especially the existence of past priority-setting efforts in global health),
and the main uncertainty is regarding interpreting claims of newness.*

# Summary

Both members of the effective altruism movement as well as opponents explicitly
claim or imply that effective altruism is "new" in the sense that it prioritizes
between different causes and interventions. I claim that while effective
altruism is new for

- bringing the lessons of effective philanthropy to the world of private donors,
- cause prioritization,
- advancing arguments around earning to give, and
- producing a unique movement around the idea of effective philanthropy,

that the idea of prioritization itself is not new. In particular, I will draw on
the history of priority-setting in global health (one of the main causes of
effective altruism) to show this. I finally suggest exploring the history of
global health, philanthropy, and various movements as a way to ground the
movement among past and current efforts and to guard against criticisms of
arrogance.

# Claims that effective altruism is new

[Katja Grace asks why effective altruism is new and obvious][katja post]

Katja:

> On the other hand, if an idea is too obviously correct for anyone to advocate
> for, you might expect more people to actually be doing it, or trying to do it.
> I'm not sure how many people were trying to be effective altruists in the past
> on their own, but I don't think it was a large fraction.

And concludes:

> If Effective Altruism really stands for pursuing unusual values, and
> furthermore doing this via zealous emphasis on accurate metrics, I'm not
> especially surprised that it wasn't thought of years ago, nor that people
> disagree.

Katja quotes [Ben Kuhn][ben post], who writes:

> Effective altruists often express surprise that the idea of effective altruism
> only came about so recently. For instance, my student group recently hosted
> Elie Hassenfeld for a talk in which he made remarks to that effect, and I’ve
> heard other people working for EA organizations express the same sentiment.
> But no one seems to be actually worried about this---just smug that they’ve
> figured out something that no one else had.
>
> The “market” for ideas is at least somewhat efficient: most simple, obvious
> and correct things get thought of fairly quickly after it's possible to think
> them. If a meme as simple as effective altruism hasn't taken root yet, we
> should at least try to understand why before throwing our weight behind it.
> The absence of such attempts---in other words, the fact that non-obviousness
> doesn’t make effective altruists worried that they’re missing something---is a
> strong indicator against the “effective altruists are actually trying”
> hypothesis.

Jeff Kaufman [mentions][sc post] "the paradox of EA being both obvious and new"
in a Facebook post (implying others have talked about this).

(But what does he mean by "economic research" and "now"?)

Some of these are unclear about whether they just mean that EA itself is new, or
whether the whole idea of prioritizing among causes or interventions is new.

Even from critics of effective altruism; from [Daron Acemoglu][acemoglu]:

Or [Iason Gabriel][gabriel response]:

[Charity Navigator][cn] (though part of their criticism is that GiveWell only
recommends charities in global health and nutrition):

It's difficult to decisively claim that people think effective altruism is
totally new, and in fact I would expect that if pushed, people would say they're
not entirely sure. But I still think it *is* notable that people omit discussion
of priority-setting efforts in global health and treat effective altruism as a
new movement *because* they prioritize between interventions. It's also
difficult to convey the "vibe" through quotes; there are probably several more
like the ones above that I've missed, as well as a more implicit belief that
effective altruism is new.

# Previous and ongoing prioritization efforts in global health

-   The ["Timeline of nonprofit evaluation"][timeline ne] on Wikipedia, which
    was started by me but expanded significantly by Vipul Naik, documents some
    of the history of evaluating nonprofits, including the [Scientific Charity
    Movement][scm].
-   My Wikipedia [draft page for "Priority-setting in global health"][psigh
    draft], which shows that *explicit prioritization* in global health has been
    going on since at least the 1970s -- around 30 years before the effective
    altruism movement even formed.

# In what ways is effective altruism new?

-   New in the sense that it spreads lessons from effective philanthropy to the
    world of private donors.

-   Takes the final step back in terms of prioritization level to reach *cause
    prioritization*. GiveWell [outlines in a post][cause selection] that
    "philanthropists seem to be least thoughtful and to ask the fewest critical
    questions" when picking causes. But just as well, they say that the
    subsequent steps -- namely developing a cause-specific "foundation strategy"
    and evaluating grantees and potential grantees -- "seem likely to lead to at
    least reasonable results if carried out by people who listen well and keep
    their minds open". I interpret this as evidence that GiveWell realizes that
    within causes, philanthropy has already done reasonably well in terms of
    prioritization.

-   Earning to give: the idea itself did not seem to originate within the EA
    movement, but the EA movement seems to have popularized the idea and also
    combined it with considerations of replaceability. For more on this, see
    Jeff Kaufman's posts: parts [I][etg i], [II][etg ii], and [III][etg iii].

-   Also worth quoting is [Brian Tomasik][tomasik comment]:

    > Honestly, I think this idea is one of EA's bigger oversights -- not that
    > people haven't noticed that EA is recent, but that people don't realize
    > that it's *not* recent. The components of EA have each existed for
    > millennia, and movements combining several parts are also ancient. This
    > particular combination may be a little different from past movements, but
    > not more than past movements have been from each other.
    >
    > On the whole, I think EAs vastly overestimate their value relative to
    > everyone else in the world who are actually doing some really important
    > work as well but don't happen to be part of our social circles. I agree
    > that EAs (myself included) would do well to explore more different
    > perspectives on the world beyond the boundaries of their community.

    From the framework of "components of EA", I have only examined one
    component, namely, priority-setting in global health.

# Conclusion

- suggest people to look more into history of philanthropy and so forth (e.g.
  look at GiveWell's work)
