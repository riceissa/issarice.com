[Katja Grace asks why effective altruism is new and obvious][katja post]

Katja:

> On the other hand, if an idea is too obviously correct for anyone to advocate
> for, you might expect more people to actually be doing it, or trying to do it.
> I'm not sure how many people were trying to be effective altruists in the past
> on their own, but I don't think it was a large fraction.

And concludes:

> If Effective Altruism really stands for pursuing unusual values, and
> furthermore doing this via zealous emphasis on accurate metrics, I'm not
> especially surprised that it wasn't thought of years ago, nor that people
> disagree.

[Ben Kuhn][ben post]:

Even from critics of effective altruism; from [Daron Acemoglu][acemoglu]:

> on *effective measurement*: we cannot measure accurately which organizations
> use resources most effectively. More evidence is always preferred, but precise
> measurement of the social value of a donated dollar may be impossible. What is
> the social value of a dollar given to Amnesty International as opposed to
> Oxfam or an NGO providing vaccines or textbooks? Every measurement involves
> value judgments. How much more valuable is to save the life of a one-year-old
> than to send a six-year-old to school?

Or [Iason Gabriel][gabriel response]:

> For example, effective altruists do not care about who benefits from an
> intervention or in what way, only that the greatest total gain in well-being
> is achieved. This means they often overlook the weakest and most vulnerable
> members of a population, who are frequently illiterate, victims of
> discrimination, and consigned to geographically remote places. Many of them
> also suffer from disabilities that place out of reach the welfare gains
> able-bodied people can achieve. Therefore effective altruists tend to focus
> their efforts elsewhere. This approach leads to systematic neglect of those
> most in need, something that strikes many people as unjust.
