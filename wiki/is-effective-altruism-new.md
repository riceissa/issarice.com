title: Is effective altruism new?

*Note: this is a draft. The claims here have not been stress-tested, so
plausibly could turn out to be misguided. The general thrust seems right to me
(especially the existence of past priority-setting efforts in global health),
and the main uncertainty is regarding interpreting claims of newness. In
addition, the parts of EA I claim are new could turn out not to be new (given
further investigation).*

# Summary

Both members of the effective altruism movement as well as opponents explicitly
claim or imply that effective altruism is "new" in the sense that it prioritizes
between different causes and interventions. I claim that effective altruism is
new for:

- bringing the lessons of effective philanthropy to the world of private donors,
- cause prioritization,
- advancing arguments around earning to give, and
- producing a unique movement around the idea of effective philanthropy.

However, the idea of prioritization itself is not new. In particular, I will
draw on the history of priority-setting in global health (one of the main causes
of effective altruism) to show this, and I also consolidate previous critiques
of the effective altruism movement along these lines. I finally suggest
exploring the history of global health, philanthropy, and various movements as a
way to ground the movement in past and current efforts and to guard against
criticisms of arrogance.

# Claims that effective altruism is new

In this section, I collect statements along the lines that effective altruism is
a new idea, specifically for trying to prioritize between interventions. I
include both statements from those in the broader effective altruism community
(though I realize that community membership is a fuzzy notion) as well as from
pieces critical of the effective altruism movement. I also want to emphasize
that there is quite a bit of uncertainty regarding interpreting claims of
newness; in many cases it is not clear what precisely people are claiming or
implying.

[Katja Grace asks why effective altruism is "new and obvious"][katja post] in a
post, and begins by quoting [Ben Kuhn][ben post], who writes:

Jeff Kaufman [mentions][sc post] "the paradox of EA being both obvious and new"
in a Facebook post (implying others have talked about this).

It's not clear what exactly he means by "economic research" and "until now".

Note that it's unclear about whether she just means that EA itself is new, or
whether the whole idea of prioritizing among causes or interventions is new.

The following are some criticisms of effective altruism that specifically
mention prioritization.

[Charity Navigator][cn]:

Charity Navigator restricts its criticism to effective altruism even though it
seems to me that it would apply to priority-setting in global health as well.
This could mean:

-   Charity Navigator is implying that effective altruism is new for its
    prioritization efforts (because nobody else does this sort of
    prioritization).
-   Charity Navigator only intended to restrict its criticism to effective
    altruism, and had it had more time, would have extended its criticism to
    prioritization efforts in global health and elsewhere.
-   Charity Navigator for some reason restricts its criticism of prioritization
    efforts to private donations, but is fine with prioritization efforts done
    by national or international bodies.

[Iason Gabriel][gabriel response]:

As with the Charity Navigator quote above, Gabriel is possibly implying that
effective altruism is new (by not extending the criticism to others who do the
same sort of prioritization).

In contrast, some, like [Catherine Tumber][tumber], make it clear that they are
responding to utilitarianism itself, and are simply *instantiating the
criticism* because they happen to be talking about effective altruism:

> Utilitarianism, with its bent toward quantification, for regarding people as

> impersonal corporate entities. Singer's variation rejects the ethical

>
> The suffering are units to be managed effectively; the more of them so
> managed, the better from an ethical perspective. \[...\] That is what happens
> when you reduce self and others to quantifiable widgets, much as the global

It's difficult to decisively claim that people think effective altruism is
totally new, and in fact I would expect that if pushed, people would say they're
not entirely sure. But I still think it *is* notable that people omit discussion
of priority-setting efforts in global health and treat effective altruism as a
new movement *because* they prioritize between interventions. It's also
difficult to convey the "vibe" through quotes; there are probably several more
like the ones above that I've missed, as well as a more implicit belief that
effective altruism is new.

# Previous remarks that effective altruism isn't new

Several people have noted that effective altruism isn't new. The instances of
this I could find are all in response to [Ben Kuhn's post][ben post] that was
mentioned above.

[Brian Tomasik][tomasik comment]:

From the framework of "components of EA", I will only examine priority-setting
and the evaluation of nonprofits. Moreover for the former, I have only looked
for precedents in global health.

Similarly, [Philip\_W][philip] comments that the Rotary Club has some of the
aspects of effective altruism.

# Previous and ongoing prioritization efforts in global health and philanthropy

Now I aim to show that prioritization itself is not new in global health or in
philanthropy in general. Consider the following:

-   The ["Timeline of nonprofit evaluation"][timeline ne] on Wikipedia
    (initially written by me but expanded significantly by Vipul Naik) documents
    some of the history of evaluating nonprofits, including the [Scientific
    Charity Movement][scm]. Various aspects of prioritization like
    data-collection, the idea of a charity watchdog, and outcome-based
    prioritization were in existence for at least several decades before the
    effective altruism movement emerged. Note that this isn't to imply that
    effective altruism has not refined these ideas.
-   ["Priority-setting in global health"][psigh] on Wikipedia (written by me)
    shows that *explicit prioritization* in global health has been going on
    since at least the 1970s -- around 30 years before the effective altruism
    movement even formed.

# Criticisms of priority-setting in global health

It is interesting to compare criticisms of effective altruism to those of
priority-setting in global health.

I've compiled some of the criticisms of priority-setting in global health at
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority-setting_in_global_health#Reception>,
though I expect there to be others I haven't encountered. Tentatively, I find it
interesting that while criticisms of effective altruism's prioritization focus
on whether it is okay to prioritize, the criticisms of priority-setting in
global health focus on the specific approaches taken.

# In what ways is effective altruism new?

-   New in the sense that it spreads lessons from effective philanthropy to the
    world of private donors, and does so online.
-   Takes the final step back in terms of prioritization level to reach *cause
    prioritization* (maybe). GiveWell [outlines in a post][cause selection] that
    "philanthropists seem to be least thoughtful and to ask the fewest critical
    questions" when picking causes. But just as well, they say that the
    subsequent steps -- namely developing a cause-specific "foundation strategy"
    and evaluating grantees and potential grantees -- "seem likely to lead to at
    least reasonable results if carried out by people who listen well and keep
    their minds open". I interpret this as evidence that GiveWell realizes that
    within causes, philanthropy has already done reasonably well in terms of
    prioritization.
-   Earning to give: the idea itself did not seem to originate within the EA
    movement, but the EA movement seems to have popularized the idea and also
    combined it with considerations of replaceability. For more on this, see
    Jeff Kaufman's posts: parts [I][etg i], [II][etg ii], and [III][etg iii].

# Conclusion

-   Suggest people to look more into history of philanthropy and so forth (e.g.
    look at GiveWell's work)
-   Claims of newness are inherently strong, because they say something about
    everything that happened before some point in time. Humility requires one to
    explain where and how one searched before concluding that something is new.
-   ~~Give me examples of other systematic prioritization efforts so I don't
    have to do the work myself.~~ Are there other instances of systematic
    prioritization within philanthropic movements?
