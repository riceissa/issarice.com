# Claims that effective altruism is new

[Katja Grace asks why effective altruism is new and obvious][katja post]

Katja:

> On the other hand, if an idea is too obviously correct for anyone to advocate
> for, you might expect more people to actually be doing it, or trying to do it.
> I'm not sure how many people were trying to be effective altruists in the past
> on their own, but I don't think it was a large fraction.

And concludes:

> If Effective Altruism really stands for pursuing unusual values, and
> furthermore doing this via zealous emphasis on accurate metrics, I'm not
> especially surprised that it wasn't thought of years ago, nor that people
> disagree.

Katja quotes [Ben Kuhn][ben post], who writes:

> Effective altruists often express surprise that the idea of effective altruism
> only came about so recently. For instance, my student group recently hosted
> Elie Hassenfeld for a talk in which he made remarks to that effect, and I’ve
> heard other people working for EA organizations express the same sentiment.
> But no one seems to be actually worried about this—just smug that they’ve
> figured out something that no one else had.
>
> The “market” for ideas is at least somewhat efficient: most simple, obvious
> and correct things get thought of fairly quickly after it's possible to think
> them. If a meme as simple as effective altruism hasn't taken root yet, we
> should at least try to understand why before throwing our weight behind it.
> The absence of such attempts—in other words, the fact that non-obviousness
> doesn’t make effective altruists worried that they’re missing something—is a
> strong indicator against the “effective altruists are actually trying”
> hypothesis.

Even from critics of effective altruism; from [Daron Acemoglu][acemoglu]:

> on *effective measurement*: we cannot measure accurately which organizations
> use resources most effectively. More evidence is always preferred, but precise
> measurement of the social value of a donated dollar may be impossible. What is
> the social value of a dollar given to Amnesty International as opposed to
> Oxfam or an NGO providing vaccines or textbooks? Every measurement involves
> value judgments. How much more valuable is to save the life of a one-year-old
> than to send a six-year-old to school?

Or [Iason Gabriel][gabriel response]:

> For example, effective altruists do not care about who benefits from an
> intervention or in what way, only that the greatest total gain in well-being
> is achieved. This means they often overlook the weakest and most vulnerable
> members of a population, who are frequently illiterate, victims of
> discrimination, and consigned to geographically remote places. Many of them
> also suffer from disabilities that place out of reach the welfare gains
> able-bodied people can achieve. Therefore effective altruists tend to focus
> their efforts elsewhere. This approach leads to systematic neglect of those
> most in need, something that strikes many people as unjust.

Or [Catherine Tumber][tumber]:

> Utilitarianism, with its bent toward quantification, for regarding people as
> abstract units, is the ethical system of distant administrators. It is no
> coincidence that it emerged in the nineteenth century with the rise of large,
> impersonal corporate entities. Singer's variation rejects the ethical
> philosophy's pleasure-or-pain calculus as too subjective and, potentially,
> hedonistic. His own *preference utilitarianism* seeks to rescue ethics from
> categorical abstraction while restoring grounds for subjective rational
> choice. \[...\]
>
> \[...\] The suffering are units to be managed effectively; the more of them so
> managed, the better from an ethical perspective. \[...\] That is what happens
> when you reduce self and others to quantifiable widgets, much as the global
> financial markets regard us.

# Previous and ongoing prioritization efforts in global health

- [Timeline of nonprofit evaluation][timeline ne]
- My [draft page for priority-setting in global health][psigh draft], which
  shows that *explicit prioritization* in global health has been going on since
  at least the 1970s -- around 30 years before the effective altruism movement
  even formed.

# In what ways is effective altruism new?

- New in the sense that it spreads lessons from effective philanthropy to the
  world of private donors.
- Takes the final step back in terms of prioritization level to reach *cause
  prioritization*. GiveWell [outlines in a post][cause selection] that
  "philanthropists seem to be least thoughtful and to ask the fewest critical
  questions" when picking causes. But just as well, they say that the subsequent
  steps -- namely developing a cause-specific "foundation strategy" and
  evaluating grantees and potential grantees -- "seem likely to lead to at least
  reasonable results if carried out by people who listen well and keep their
  minds open". I interpret this as evidence that GiveWell realizes that within
  causes, philanthropy has already done reasonably well in terms of
  prioritization.
