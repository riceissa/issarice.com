Although I haven't spent too much time investigating all resources on [effective altruism]() (EA), it seems that right now, discussions are occurring in disparate places, and that coordination between these places is lacking.
It is difficult, for instance, to find all EA discussions that have taken place on giving now or later, or to find all discussions on going into finance.
The goal of this page is to *slowly* compile all discussions that have taken place about EA on particular topics.
I have also recently started the [Cause Prioritization Wiki](http://causeprioritization.org), which also focuses on information-gathering, but the wiki has the goal of comparing different causes, not just amassing EA discussions of them.

The list is alphabetized except for the very first item ("General/introductory discussions").

I'm uncertain of the utility of this list.
In a sense, it is just a collection of the "effective altruism versions" of various topics that are already discussed elsewhere (though I also think that EAs have probably added a lot to some discussions, like those on animal suffering and existential risks).

# General/introductory discussions

- [Introduction to Effective Altruism](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/) on the new EA forum.
- [Effective altruism learning resources](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Effective_altruism_learning_resources) on the Cognito Mentoring wiki.
- [On Caring](http://lesswrong.com/lw/l30/on_caring/)
- [Effective Altruism is a Question (not an ideology)](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/9s/effective_altruism_is_a_question_not_an_ideology/)
- [Efficient Charity: Do Unto Others...](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gj/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/)

# Cause prioritization

I'm currently working on cause prioritization research through the [cause prioritization wiki](http://causeprioritization.org), though the project is still at a very early stage.
You can find my original public announcement about doing cause prioritization research ("cause prioritization prioritization") [here](https://www.facebook.com/riceissa/posts/1492279381051014).

# Depression

# Digital preservation

See [Digital preservation]() and the [digital preservation article on the CP wiki](http://causeprioritization.org/Digital%20preservation).
(I'm still not entirely sure how I should try to split content between the two.
I suppose the latter will only contain information about how important it is to do this, how much cost is involved in large-scale efforts, etc., i.e. more "impersonal" stuff, while the former will be more of a "do it yourself" type page.)

# Donating now versus later

- [Reasons for donating now rather than later](https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/790439427679083)<!--(https://archive.is/3lVIF)-->

# EA in different languages

- The most obvious step is to look at all the meetups [here](http://effective-altruism.com/meetups/) and talk to the people that go to them.

# Earning-to-give

- [Talent or Money?](http://www.jefftk.com/p/talent-or-money)

# Local groups

## EA in universities

- There is [Harvard EA](http://harvardea.org/), started by [Ben Kuhn](http://www.benkuhn.net/studentgroup).

- Some other universities have a Giving What We Can chapter instead.

- If you're interested in connecting with student EA leaders, see the Google group [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ea-student-leaders).

- I'm trying to see if one can be started at the University of Washington; see [this Quora question](https://www.quora.com/Who-is-interested-in-an-effective-altruism-group-club-at-the-University-of-Washington) and [this](https://www.facebook.com/john.salvatier/posts/10103444497526248) (private) Facebook post.

- [Post about Stanford EA](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/kh/stanford_ea_history_and_lessons_learned/) that has some helpful information.

# Meta

- [Supportive Scepticism](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/7x/supportive_scepticism/) discusses how to strike a balance between not caring about doing the most effective thing (and thus not being an "effective" altruist) and caring too much about doing the most effective thing (and thus getting stuck in "analysis paralysis").

# Organizations

There are quite a few organizations that are at least peripherally associated with the effective altruism movement:

- GiveWell
- The Center for Effective Altruism
    - Giving What We Can
- THINK (The High Impact NetworK)
- The life you can save
- \[note: add more\]

# Outreach

- Potential [online course](https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/768223419900684/)?

- [Post](http://roxanneheston.com/2014/09/20/on-turning-down-requests-part-1-of-2/) by Roxanne Heston on turning down requests that are "not effective enough".
This is related to the problem of trying to attract people who are interested in altruism to become effective altruists.
[Related discussion](https://www.facebook.com/vipulnaik.r/posts/10204324324964174), though it's not public.


# Potentially risky acts

- [How can effective altruists effectively use their own deaths if they are old and have little they can do in life?](https://www.quora.com/How-can-effective-altruists-effectively-use-their-own-deaths-if-they-are-old-and-have-little-they-can-do-in-life)

- Lila Rieber on [paying people to participate in dangerous human trials](https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/768177973238562/)


# Romance

- Vipul Naik asks, ["What are some pros and cons, from the EA perspective, of an EA giving preference to EAs in the dating market?"](https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/749858421737184/) on the EA Facebook group

- This one isn't public, but [EA sugar babies](https://www.facebook.com/vipulnaik.r/posts/10204075715149084).


# Social movements

- Discussion [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/762885347101158/) about historical social movement leaders like King, Gandhi, and Mandela.


# Supererogation

- [Views on supererogatory acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism#Views_on_supererogatory_acts) seems to indicate that people like Peter Singer don't view EA as supererogatory.

- From experience though, at least some EAs take the view that "yes, we recognize that we're not perfect people, but at least in the possibly small ways that we want to do good in the world, we're willing to do the things that make the most difference".
