**[Long Content](http://www.gwern.net/About#long-content)** is a style of [content creation]() where one has "perpetual drafts" that one improves over time.
This is in contrast to a style where one publishes once and in the long term does not come back to edit/maintain the content.
The term was first [defined by gwern](http://www.gwern.net/About#long-content) regarding his website.
As gwern writes, the idea follows from thinking in the [Long Now](!w)-style.
Although the term was defined by gwern, the idea has essentially been brought up in other places as well.
For instance here is Peter Thiel, applying the idea to one's life:

> People always say they want to live every day as though it will be their
> last. I always have this contrasting view that I think I’d like to live
> every day as though it will go on for ever.
>
> If we had an indefinite life span, we would continue to work and start
> great new projects, we would be very careful about how we treated the
> people around us because we would encounter them again.[^forever]

[^forever]: “[Peter Thiel: ‘We attribute too much to luck. Luck is an atheistic word for God’](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/21/peter-thiel-paypal-luck-atheist-god)\ ”.

> People always say you should live your life as if it were your last day.
> I think you should live your life as though it will go on for ever; that
> every day is so good that you don’t want it to end.[^telegraph]

[^telegraph]: "[Peter Thiel: the billionaire tech entrepreneur on a mission to cheat death](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/11098971/Peter-Thiel-the-billionaire-tech-entrepreneur-on-a-mission-to-cheat-death.html)"

Here is [Leonard Woolf on Virginia Woolf](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91h/preface.html):

> All through her life, Virginia Woolf used at intervals to write short stories. It was her custom, whenever an idea for one occurred to her, to sketch it out in a very rough form and then to put it away in a drawer. Later, if an editor asked her for a short story, and she felt in the mood to write one (which was not frequent), she would take a sketch out of her drawer and rewrite it, sometimes a great many times. Or if she felt, as she often did, while writing a novel that she required to rest her mind by working at something else for a time, she would either write a critical essay or work upon one of her sketches for short stories.

It's worth noting that while many authors/writers (and English teachers) keep telling people to rewrite, [Bertrand Russell](!w), for one, [has found something else](http://www.personal.kent.edu/~rmuhamma/Philosophy/RBwritings/howWrite.htm):

> I conscientiously tried [to rewrite], but found that my first draft was almost always better than my second. This discovery has saved me an immense amount of time. I do not, of course, apply it to the substance, but only to the form. When I discover an error of an important kind I re-write the whole. What I do not find is that I can improve a sentence when I am satisfied with what it means.[^florid]

The essay also contains the anecdote about when Russell "proceeded to dictate the whole book without a moment's hesitation".

(Hmm, now this page is talking also about [How to write]() and [Revising one's writings](); perhaps these need separate pages.)

[^florid]: Also I love this quote:
"There was a time, in the first years of this century, when I had more florid and rhetorical ambitions."
