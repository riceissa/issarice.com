I make some observations on my frustration with trying to extract people's
beliefs from their public statements.
This is not intended to be comprehensive or representative of reality, but more

For various reasons, I have a need to understand what people think of various
topics (where it matters *who* says them, not just the ideas contained in their
statements):
