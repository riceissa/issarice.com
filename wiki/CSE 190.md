This is my course review for [CSE 190](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse142/14au/labs.shtml) (programming lab for CSE 142) at the University of Washington.
I took the course in autumn 2014.

There isn't a lot to say about this course: it was a 1-credit course where each week one goes to one of the computer labs and works through a slideshow containing programming problems.

I'm not sure I gained much from the course.
I think it mainly gave me some time each week to practice some of the ideas from class, so I didn't have to work very much on my own time.
In other words, CSE 190 provided a structure for work that I might have done on my own anyway.
