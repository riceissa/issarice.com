*These are some notes on global public health as part of a larger project.
The final results will likely not be published here (but I will try to link to them from here when they're done), but this is the most convenient place for notes.*

# When and how did global health become a movement?

Some relevant Quora questions I've asked that might spring up useful information:

- [When did global health charities start to emerge?](https://www.quora.com/unanswered/When-did-global-health-charities-start-to-emerge)
- [How did global health become "commodified" \(through a movement advocating donations\)?](https://www.quora.com/unanswered/How-did-global-health-become-commodified-through-a-movement-advocating-donations)
- [How did global public health become so popular?](https://www.quora.com/unanswered/How-did-global-public-health-become-so-popular)

Initial hypotheses (after reading [the Wikipedia section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health#History)):

- The push toward global health was *crisis-driven*, in the sense that outbreaks somewhat unrelated to the rest of global health were responsible for kick-starting interest in the rest of the area.
The analogy here is that things like natural disasters influence people to donate more money.
- Somehow organizations like the WHO formed and convinced people to donate more money.

It's important to distinguish between government interest and public interest in global health.
It seems that government interest came first, followed by public interest.
There is also "philanthropic interest" from individuals with a lot of money.

[This page](http://www.who.int/global_health_histories/background/en/) provides an outline of how government bodies formed, but not a lot of underlying motivation.

'[The World Health Organization and the Transition From “International” to “Global” Public Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470434/)':

> “International health” was already a term of considerable currency in the
> late 19th and early 20th century, when it referred primarily to a focus on
> the control of epidemics across the boundaries between nations (i.e.,
> “international”). [...] “Global health,” in general, implies consideration of
> the health needs of the people of the whole planet above the concerns of
> particular nations. The term “global” is also associated with the growing
> importance of actors beyond governmental or intergovernmental organizations
> and agencies—for example, the media, internationally influential foundations,
> nongovernmental organizations, and transnational corporations.

On potential motivations for countries like the US:

> In 1955, Candau was charged with overseeing WHO’s campaign of malaria
> eradication, approved that year by the World Health Assembly. The ambitious
> goal of malaria eradication had been conceived and promoted in the context of
> great enthusiasm and optimism about the ability of widespread DDT spraying to
> kill mosquitoes. As Randall Packard has argued, the United States and its
> allies believed that global malaria eradication would usher in economic
> growth and create overseas markets for US technology and manufactured goods.
> It would build support for local governments and their US supporters and help
> win “hearts and minds” in the battle against Communism. Mirroring
> then-current development theories, the campaign promoted technologies brought
> in from outside and made no attempt to enlist the participation of local
> populations in planning or implementation. This model of development
> assistance fit neatly into US Cold War efforts to promote modernization with
> limited social reform.

Interesting note on WHO's funding:

> Another symptom of WHO’s problems in the late 1980s was the growth of
> “extrabudgetary” funding. As Gill Walt of the London School of Hygiene and
> Tropical Medicine noted, there was a crucial shift from predominant reliance
> on WHO’s “regular budget”—drawn from member states’ contributions on the
> basis of population size and gross national product—to greatly increased
> dependence on extrabudgetary funding coming from donations by multilateral
> agencies or “donor” nations. By the period 1986–1987, extrabudgetary funds of
> $437 million had almost caught up with the regular budget of $543 million. By
> the beginning of the 1990s, extra-budgetary funding had overtaken the regular
> budget by $21 million, contributing 54% of WHO’s overall budget.

1990s:

> Best-selling books and news magazines were full of stories about Ebola and
> West Nile virus, resurgent tuberculosis, and the threat of bioterrorism. The
> message was clear: there was a palpable global disease threat.

[This Harvard course](https://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic606990.files/HS%20148%20Syllabus%20History%20of%20Global%20Health.pdf) spends quite a bit of time on the role of missionaries.
I'm not sure if it's worth looking into.

# What does the success of global health tell us about other movements?

Specifically, I'm interested in anti-aging.
