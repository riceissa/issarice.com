# When and how did global health become a movement?

Some relevant Quora questions I've asked that might spring up useful information:

- [When did global health charities start to emerge?](https://www.quora.com/unanswered/When-did-global-health-charities-start-to-emerge)
- [How did global health become "commodified" \(through a movement advocating donations\)?](https://www.quora.com/unanswered/How-did-global-health-become-commodified-through-a-movement-advocating-donations)
- [How did global public health become so popular?](https://www.quora.com/unanswered/How-did-global-public-health-become-so-popular)

# What does the success of global health tell us about other movements?

Specifically, I'm interested in anti-aging.
