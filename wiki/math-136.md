This is my course review for math 136 at University of Washington.
I took the course in spring 2015 with [Ebru Bekyel].  This class is a
continuation of [math 134]() and [math 135](), which I took the previous
two quarters at UW.  You can look at the [course webpage] ([archived] as
of the end of the quarter) for some of the course content.

# Content

The first seven weeks or so covered the basics of linear algebra,
including finite vector spaces; matrices; linear transformation, kernel
and image; eigenvalues and eigenvectors; change of basis; self-adjoint,
normal, unitary, and orthogonal matrices; and diagonalization. (These
topics were covered in the first and second midterms.) Following this,
the course went on to cover some vector calculus (a continuation from
what we covered in math 135).

## Textbooks

We used Treil's *[Linear Algebra Done Wrong][ladw]* for linear algebra,
and *Calculus* by Salas, Hille, and Etgen (the same book we used in math
134 and 135) for vector calculus.

# Difficulty

I thought the linear algebra part of the course was much more difficult
than any part of the previous two quarters. In high school, we did some
calculations involving matrices, but this was at a very basic level, so
I didn't have too strong of a background in linear algebra[^calc].
Moreover the abstract nature of linear algebra (at least, compared to
calculus) made it difficult to "grok" many of the theorems that we
covered in class.

[^calc]: This is unlike in math 134 when I had already partially
self-studied proof-based calculus, making the course relatively easier,
and also unlike the vector calculus part of 136, where everything was
very visual so it was easy to have good intution when working on
problems.

# Camaraderie

I only went to two TA office hours this quarter (for the two midterm
review sessions) and attended one group study session (right before the
second midterm). Overall, I thought that while people in the class had
gotten more used to each other, that there was perhaps less group work
when working on assignments.
