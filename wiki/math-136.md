This is my course review for math 136 at University of Washington.
I took the course in spring 2015 with [Ebru Bekyel].  This class is a
continuation of [math 134]() and [math 135](), which I took the previous
two quarters at UW.  You can look at the [course webpage] ([archived] as
of the end of the quarter) for some of the course content.

# Content

The first seven weeks or so covered the basics of linear algebra,
including finite vector spaces; matrices; linear transformation, kernel
and image; eigenvalues and eigenvectors; change of basis; self-adjoint,
normal, unitary, and orthogonal matrices; and diagonalization. (These
topics were covered in the first and second midterms.) Following this,
the course went on to cover some vector calculus (a continuation from
what we covered in math 135).

## Textbooks

We used Treil's *[Linear Algebra Done Wrong][ladw]* for linear algebra,
and *Calculus* by Salas, Hille, and Etgen (the same book we used in math
134 and 135) for vector calculus.
