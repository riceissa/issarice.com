- the connection between hiring people for a job and judging the
  character of people fascinates me (e.g. for finding good friends, or
  for romantic relationships).
- both are clearly important: you need to hire people to get tasks done,
  and you want to find good friends/partner(s)
- both can take quite a bit of commitnment to accurately judge
- both can end disastrously
- in both scenarios, there can be multiple people doing the judging, so
  there can be some gossip among those "in the know"
- sometimes it can be *really hard* to tell the difference between
  someone who is an *extremely* good fit, and someone who is a terrible
  fit.

        > Look to referrals of referrals.  Look for the best person
        > according to the best person according to the best person you
        > know (yes, that's two levels).  If there is consensus among
        > several of your best people, this is a fairly reliable
        > indicator.  It is difficult to go more than 3x per "link"
        > though - people are typically unable to discern the difference
        > between someone 9x as good as they are from someone who is 3x
        > as good as they are; this is why you have to do the "best
        > person you know" referral twice.  First, you hire all the best
        > people you know, work with them for awhile to find the best
        > amongst them, and then find all the best people *they* know. 
        > It is a multiple-stage approach; many people don't know this,
        > and just assume that "refer the best people you know" is the
        > end of it.
