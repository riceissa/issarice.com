- <http://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/29/we-cant-simply-buy-capacity/>
- the connection between hiring people for a job and judging the
  character of people fascinates me (e.g. for finding good friends, or
  for romantic relationships).
- both are clearly important: you need to hire people to get tasks done,
  and you want to find good friends/partner(s)
- both can take quite a bit of commitnment to accurately judge
- both can end disastrously
- in both scenarios, there can be multiple people doing the judging, so
  there can be some gossip among those "in the know"
- sometimes it can be *really hard* to tell the difference between
  someone who is an *extremely* good fit, and someone who is a terrible
  fit.
