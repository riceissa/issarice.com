- [We Can’t \(Simply\) Buy Capacity](http://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/29/we-cant-simply-buy-capacity/)
- the connection between hiring people for a job and judging the
  character of people fascinates me (e.g. for finding good friends, or
  for romantic relationships).
- both are clearly important: you need to hire people to get tasks done,
  and you want to find good friends/partner(s)
- both can take quite a bit of commitment to accurately judge
- both can end disastrously (due diligence)
- in both scenarios, there can be multiple people doing the judging, so
  there can be some gossip among those "in the know"
- sometimes it can be *really hard* to tell the difference between
  someone who is an *extremely* good fit, and someone who is a terrible
  fit.

        Similarly, stalking someone's friends might be useful if you
        want to determine their character.

        Similar is a [post by Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10154648023319228):

        > People can't distinguish better or worse within more than one

        > were two superintelligences or just \>Eliezers arguing with each

- GiveWell has [The process of hiring our first cause-specific Program Officer](http://blog.givewell.org/2015/09/03/the-process-of-hiring-our-first-cause-specific-program-officer/).
Talking about senior hiring, they list some general principles:

    > -   The best way to evaluate someone is to work with them. The ideal way
    >     to make a senior hire would be to have a longstanding relationship
    >     with someone, perhaps as a part-time consulting arrangement.
    > -   Interviews are highly unreliable. The evaluation process should be
    >     designed as much as possible to mimic working together.
    > -   References are extremely important, and it can be useful to talk to
    >     many people about the candidate (including people who weren’t
    >     specifically offered as references).

    Also:

    > When a candidate didn’t mention a major aspect of the criminal

    > were omitting it because they (a) had strong knowledge of it and
    > were making a considered decision to de-prioritize this aspect of
    > the field; (b) didn’t have much experience or knowledge of this
    > area of the field.

    (So the general lesson here might be "do your homework" before trying to hire people.)
