- Make or add to Wikipedia pages in the course of reading about a topic.
- Frequently Google for information to build understanding of the base rates in the area you're reading about.
- Google the topic with the names of various organizations or movements or ideologies (to build intuition for what various people think about the topic).
- Email relevant people for more information if you can't find what you're looking for (and remember to follow up if they don't respond).
- Archive your online sources to combat linkrot.
I use the Scrapbook addon in Firefox (local archive), as well as Pinboard (personal online archive) and Archive.org (public online archive).
