Or "How rational is it to fall in love with GiveWell at first sight?"

Or "How rational is it to fall in love with EA at first sight?"

By "first principles", I mean to work off of a deliberately stripped-down
epistemic framework, where:

  * I assume no social connection to the effective altruism community,
    rationalist community, or GiveWell. The reality is that I tend to have
    around 100 mutual Facebook friends with "inner" members of the effective
    altruism community and I've been [personally involved][involvement] with
    the community in various ways. I haven't [personally donated][donations] to
    GiveWell or its recommended charities, but many of the people I have
    interacted with have.

The point of the exercise is that I'm trying to create a "clean environment"
where I can reason about topics that effective altruists frequently discuss,
but where I don't bring in their specific conclusions.

However, I *don't* mean "first principles" in some contrived Russellian
deductive sense.
