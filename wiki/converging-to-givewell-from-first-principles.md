Or "How rational is it to fall in love with GiveWell at first sight?"

Or "How rational is it to fall in love with EA at first sight?"

By "first principles", I mean to work off of a deliberately stripped-down
epistemic framework, where:

  * I assume no social connection to the effective altruism community,
    rationalist community, or GiveWell. The reality is that I tend to have
    around 100 mutual Facebook friends with "inner" members of the effective
    altruism community and I've been [personally involved][involvement] with
    the community in various ways. I haven't [personally donated][donations] to
    GiveWell or its recommended charities, but many of the people I have
    interacted with have.
  * I assume access to the Wikipedia [timeline of nonprofit evaluation][tone].
    (Disclosure: I wrote the original version of the timeline, which was
    subsequently expanded by Vipul Naik, who also has [involvement with the EA
    community][vip_i].) In particular, I assume that one knows about the
    existence of GiveWell, Charity Navigator, and the Gates Foundation. This
    mostly saves time Googling for nonprofit evaluators and then trying to
    obtain independent descriptions of them.
  * I assume one is trying to find the best giving opportunity, that is, a
    charity or other entity to which one can donate money that would cause the
    most good. I will also assume a comfortable financial position. Note that
    in reality, I don't even have a financial buffer or income that allows me
    to comfortably donate.
  * I assume I am not biased toward any specific cause. In particular, nothing
    of the form "My relative is diagnosed with disease X so I feel compelled,
    on an emotional level, to give to that cause" or "In my childhood, I was
    disadvantaged in way Y so I want to help people in similar positions to my
    past self".

The point of the exercise is that I'm trying to create a "clean environment"
where I can reason about topics that effective altruists frequently discuss,
but where I don't bring in their specific conclusions takes on things. To be
sure, it is an artificial environment, but one which I expect emulates well
that of a typical "proto-EA".

However, I *don't* mean "first principles" in some contrived Russellian
deductive sense.

Now my question is, given the above setup, i.e. a generally "rational" person
inclined to do the most good possible through donations, would one converge on
EAs' favorite causes or GiveWell top-rated charities? How would such a person
carry out this investigation? How would they even start? Would they be
convinced by GiveWell's research? Would they clearly see Against Malaria
Foundation as the best charity combating malaria?
