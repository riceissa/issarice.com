This is my course review for [CSE 311: Foundations of Computing I](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse311/15au/).
I took the course in spring 2015 with [Shayan Oveis Gharan](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shayan/).

# Content

Basically straight out of Rosen.

# Homework

The class uses Gradescope, which is free but annoying to use.
The PDFs of the homework are posted online, which students must print (in order to do the homework), but then must scan back into a PDF to turn in...

- Lauren Wolfe took the course during the same quarter and has chronicled her experiences in posts such as "[Round One Complete\!](http://www.laurenwolfe.net/uw-cse-blog/2015/10/03/round-one-complete/)" on her website.
