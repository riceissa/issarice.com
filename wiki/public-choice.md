*Just thinking out loud and putting some notes. I know very little about
public choice so my thinking is likely to change over time.*

Consider the two "main" positions in public choice:

1. The public elects for good policies, but politicians renege on their
   promises, leading to bad policy.[^nisk]

2. The public is often clueless about what good policy is.  On the other
   hand, politicians usually implement what they are elected for.  So
   the ignorance of the public leads directly to bad policy.^[See for
   instance Bryan Caplan.]

What I want to claim is that for advocacy causes, the strategy for good
advocacy changes dramatically depending on which of the above two is
true.  That is, if the conclusion is that politicians just follow the
public opinion, then one should change the public opinion, but if the
conclusion is that politicians go rogue, are selfish, and heed to
corporations (or whatever the narrative is), then one should lobby for
good policy.
