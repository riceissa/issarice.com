This is my course review for CSE 473, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.
I took the course in Spring 2016 with Luke Zettlemoyer.
The course website is [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse473/16sp/).
I abbreviate the course as "AI".

# Notes

- AI is perhaps one of the most *relaxing* courses at UW.
I feel this way about [CSE 331]() as well.
The course projects are the Pacman projects from UC Berkeley's AI course, and as far as I can tell they are designed fairly well.
