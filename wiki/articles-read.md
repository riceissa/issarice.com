[web - How do I get a websites title using command line? - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/103252/how-do-i-get-a-websites-title-using-command-line)

so im going to start recording articles i've read using a script i wrote
(part of it is explained in the link above). sort of like, my own
version of evernote, except this way it'll all be git-logged and also
won't go away even if evernote does. of course, it won't log images and
stuff (at least not automatically, and not now) but you get the point.

i mean, ideally i'd put things in their *own* pages so related links are
easier to find, but realistically, im too lazy to do all that when im
just in "consuming mode", so it's best to juts postprocess things: throw
everything into this page as i go along, then come back later to
organize (by removing htings from this page and putting it in other
page). so this page will probably eternally be "notes".
