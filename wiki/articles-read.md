*This page records a subset of the articles I've read online. Additions
to this page are meant to be brief and particularly optimized for speed
instead of quality of content. Since this page will be updated much more
frequently than I deploy the site, if you intend to keep up with this
page, it's likely better to do so directly through GitHub (rather than
through this site). There is an [atom feed specific to this
page][gh_atom] that can tell you when new additions are made (though
unfortunately since it only shows the commit messages and doesn't
include the changes, it's unhelpful on its own). GitHub also makes
available the [current version of the file][gh_curr]; unfortunately even
here there is a problem: the formatting of the page may be imperfect
because GitHub does not use Pandoc markdown.*

[web - How do I get a websites title using command line? - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/103252/how-do-i-get-a-websites-title-using-command-line)

so im going to start recording articles i've read using a script i wrote
(part of it is explained in the link above). sort of like, my own
version of evernote, except this way it'll all be git-logged and also
won't go away even if evernote does. of course, it won't log images and
stuff (at least not automatically, and not now) but you get the point.

i mean, ideally i'd put things in their *own* pages so related links are
easier to find, but realistically, im too lazy to do all that when im
just in "consuming mode", so it's best to juts postprocess things: throw
everything into this page as i go along, then come back later to
organize (by removing htings from this page and putting it in other
page). so this page will probably eternally be "notes".
