This page explains my learning of libertarianism, which mostly happened during summer of 2017.

Things to mention:

- Background: I had read a lot of Bryan Caplan's blog posts, so I knew a bit about the libertarian sphere
- I think I had read at least half of Michael Huemer's *The Problem of Political Authority* prior to summer of 2017, in two phases
- I made a bunch of timelines as I went along
- Doherty's *Freewheeling History*
- I then read parts of a bunch of books like:
  - Tannehill and Tannehill's *The Market for Liberty* (too Randian)
  - Rothbard's *For a New Liberty* (didn't think the book was good, but I enjoyed Bryan Caplan's book club series on Econlog)
  - Ellickson's *Order without Law* (only read a bit of the intro)
  - David Friedman's *The Machinery of Freedom* (seemed good)
  - more?
  - a bunch of PDFs and blog posts from random places -- I didn't really keep track of this

I think TPPA is the strongest introduction to anarcho-capitalism.

I think libertarianism is one case where it is interesting to explore ideas given its assumptions (like the [homestead principle](!w)), even if you don't agree with the assumptions. [Vladimir Slepnev](http://lesswrong.com/lw/b7v/common_mistakes_people_make_when_thinking_about/) (speaking not necessarily about libertarianism): "The only way to make intellectual progress (either individually or as a group) is to explore the implications of interesting assumptions wherever they might lead. Unfortunately people love to argue about assumptions instead of getting anything done, though they can't really judge before exploring the implications in detail."

Similar [quote](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1cn/why_i_think_the_foundational_research_institute/bgt) (this time about consciousness): "What's the problem if a group of people explores the implications of a well-respected position in philosophy and are (I think) fully aware of the implications?"
