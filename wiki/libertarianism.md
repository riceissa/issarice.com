This page explains my learning of libertarianism, which mostly happened during summer of 2017.

Things to mention:

- Background: I had read a lot of Bryan Caplan's blog posts, so I knew a bit about the libertarian sphere
- I think I had read at least half of Michael Huemer's *The Problem of Political Authority* prior to summer of 2017
- I made a bunch of timelines as I went along
- Doherty's *Freewheeling History*
- I then read parts of a bunch of books like:
  - Tannehill and Tannehill's *The Market for Liberty* (too Randian)
  - Rothbard's *For a New Liberty* (didn't think the book was good, but I enjoyed Bryan Caplan's book club series on Econlog)
  - Ellickson's *Order without Law* (only read a bit of the intro)
  - David Friedman's *The Machinery of Freedom* (seemed good)
  - more?
  - a bunch of PDFs and blog posts from random places -- I didn't really keep track of this

I think TPPA is the strongest introduction to anarcho-capitalism.
