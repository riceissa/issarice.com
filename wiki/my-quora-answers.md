My main contributions to Quora are through my questions, but I don't think my answers are especially bad, so here they are.

# How do I cope with losing a long-time friend who I love?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-cope-with-losing-a-long-time-friend-who-I-love/answer/Issa-Rice); the version here has since been edited

It's unprofessional of them to refuse communication, but there isn't
anything you can do about that. Their refusal to communicate is a sign
that you shouldn't bother with them. In general, I find loneliness
preferable to interaction with unprofessional, immoral, uninteresting,
or otherwise unfit people. Finding the right people is difficult, but
until then, grit your teeth and march on. The sooner your learn this,
the better.

> How little most former friends, significant others, bosses, students,

> Conversely, how precious the few people are who still care once you

Also, although the situation here doesn't directly mirror what Caplan
describes in “[The Futility of Quarreling When There Is No Surplus to Divide](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/02/the_futility_of.html)”,
read that post and in particular this quote:

> The only way out is to calm down and admit that bad matches aren't
> anyone's fault. When two people want incompatible things, they should
> politely say goodbye and move on with their lives.

> would be better not to deal than to live with a decision that wasn’t

# Are the Vipul Naik-related questions on Quora cultish?

# Why has LinkedIn had substantially greater success and impact than OKCupid?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/Why-has-LinkedIn-had-substantially-greater-success-and-impact-than-OKCupid/answer/Issa-Rice)

I think it's helpful to consider (1) whether the business-oriented
nature of LinkedIn has given it an edge over OKCupid, a dating site; and
(2) if there is anything specifically LinkedIn has been doing right that
OKCupid hasn't.

It's not too hard to find evidence that online dating has a lot of
stigma attached to it. Here is just one article on the topic: [Online dating still stigmatized despite popularity, success](http://thegazette.com/2014/03/16/online-dating-still-stigmatized-despite-popularity-sucess/).

Online dating still stigmatized despite popularity, success. In general,
social networking sites tend to have many more users and much higher
Alexa rankings than dating sites (see [List of social networking websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_websites)
and [Comparison of online dating websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_online_dating_websites)).
If we restrict the social networking sites to just business-oriented
sites, then we find that LinkedIn has 300 million users (2013), Viadeo
has 55 million users (2013), and XING about 11 million users. In
contrast, some of the more popular online dating-focused sites like
Badoo, Match.com, and Zoosk have as many as 197 million (2013), 96
million (2010), and 50 million users (2011), respectively. So the
numbers seem rather comparable, which means LinkedIn may just be
particularly good, and OKCupid, with only 5.6 million active users
(2010), may just be particularly bad, in this respect. (Though note here
that OKCupid is the only site reporting in terms of *active* users, and
not registered users. I'm also not an expert on the other dating sites
so I can't say if OKCupid is doing something wrong.)

Other heuristics besides the stigma that one might come up with:

-   After a suitable match has been found on a dating website, the users
    may delete their profiles. I remember reading about an unfortunate
    couple who had met on OKCupid, deleted their profiles, and now
    wished to look at them again, for a sense of nostalgia -- but hadn't
    made backups of their profiles. Businesses, on the other hand, do
    not care if you have a LinkedIn profile even while you are working
    for them. (Thanks to Vipul Naik for clarifying this point with me.)
-   I get the impression that many people are officially (e.g. schools)
    or unofficially (e.g. peer pressure) *encouraged* to create LinkedIn
    profiles, which probably leads to more users, which just doesn't
    happen for dating sites (although in some social circles, creating
    online dating profiles may be encouraged somewhat).
-   The anonymity on OKCupid, in contrast to people using their real
    names on LinkedIn, could also be a factor: information on LinkedIn
    has the ability to be reused elsewhere or have a better chance of
    having an impact in other places (whereas with OKCupid, only your
    (potential) partners will ever care about the information, and it
    won't be linked to your real identity). (Thanks to Vipul Naik for
    this idea.)


# How did you discover Cognito Mentoring?

# What does Issa Rice think of Andrew J. Ho's recent questions as of 4 November 2014?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/What-does-Issa-Rice-think-of-Quora-Users-recent-questions-as-of-4-November-2014/answer/Issa-Rice)

I find them all to be very amusing. [What is it like to secretly mix in small amounts of your own blood with cookie dough that you intend on baking into cookies for your significant other?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-secretly-mix-in-small-amounts-of-your-own-blood-with-cookie-dough-that-you-intend-on-baking-into-cookies-for-your-significant-other)
in particular seems especially creative, and is giving me ideas about
other questions I could ask.

I can never tell whether your relationship questions are completely
serious or a deliberate attempt to be humorous and mocking of similar
Quora questions.

Your Asian-American questions are also highly relevant to my own
situation so I appreciate you asking those.


# What would Noam Chomsky think of unschooling?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/What-would-Noam-Chomsky-think-of-unschooling/answer/Issa-Rice)

Chomsky hated high school, so presumably his opinion of unschooling is
more positive (though it's not quite clear what type of education he
considers ideal; I suppose that he will in general support any education
system that promotes creative thinking, which includes the Deweyite
school he attended, which is mentioned in the quotes below). Some quotes
will illustrate his thinking (all emphasis mine):

> I had friends but **I hated high school**. [...] My parents worked, so
> from about 18 months I’ve been in school. But up until 8th  grade I
> was in an experimental school run by Temple University.  Progressive
> school, and that was great. But in high school I had to go  to an
> actual ‘high school’. There was one academic high school were I  was,
> one for boys, one for girls, and it was very rigid. For the  teachers
> it was a dream because the kids there wanted to go to college,  so the
> teachers could sit back and relax. But it was very rigid, you  know,
> tests, grades. I had never had grades before, never knew I was a  good
> student, nothing. And it was a bore. **It was a black hole**.

(From [The Secret of Noam: A Chomsky Interview](http://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/the-secret-of-noam-a-chomsky-interview.htm))

> There are huge efforts that do go into making people, to borrow Adam
> Smith's phrase, "as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human
> being to be." **A lot of the educational system is designed for that,
> if you think about it, it's designed for obedience and passivity**.
> From childhood, a lot of it is designed to prevent people from being
> independent and creative. **If you're independent-minded in school,
> you're probably going to get into trouble very early on**. That's not
> the trait that's being preferred or cultivated.

(From [Education is Ignorance](http://www.chomsky.info/books/warfare02.htm))

> For example, it wasn't until I was in high school that I knew I was a
> good student. The question had never arisen. I was very surprised when
> I got into high school and discovered that I was getting all A's and
> that was supposed to be a big deal. That question had never arisen in
> my entire education. In fact, every student in the school I had
> previously attended was regarded as somehow being a very successful
> student. There was no sense of competition, no ranking of students. It
> was never anything even to think about. It just never came up that
> there was a question of how you were ranked relative to other
> students. Well, anyway, at **this particular school, which was
> essentially a Deweyite school and I think a very good one, judging
> from my experience, there was a tremendous premium on personal
> creativity, not in the sense of slapping paints on paper, but doing
> the kind of work and thinking that you were interested in**. Interests
> were encouraged and children were encouraged to pursue their
> interests. They worked jointly with others or by themselves. It was a
> lively atmosphere, and the sense was that everyone was doing something
> important.
> 
> [...]
> 
> Well, then I got to high school, the academic high school in the
> public school system, which was supposed to be a very good high
> school, and it was a real shocker. For one thing, as I said, there
> was  the shock of discovering that I was a good student, which had
> never occurred to me before. And then there was the whole system of
> prestige and value that went along with that. And the intense
> competitiveness and regimentation. In fact, I can remember a lot about
> elementary school, the work I did, what I studied and so on. **I
> remember virtually nothing about high school. It's almost an absolute
> blank in my memory  apart from the emotional tone, which was quite
> negative**.
> 
> If I think back about my experience, there's a dark spot there. 
> That's what schooling generally is, I suppose. It's a period of 
> regimentation and control, part of which involves direct
> indoctrination, providing a system of false beliefs. But more
> importantly, I think, is the manner and style of **preventing and
> blocking independent and creative thinking and imposing hierarchies
> and competitiveness and the need to excel, not in the sense of doing
> as well as you can, but doing better than the next person**. Schools
> vary, of course, but I think that those features are commonplace. **I
> know that they're not necessary, because, for example, the school I
> went to as a child wasn't like that at all**.
> 
> I think schools could be run quite differently. That would be very
> important, but I really don't think that any society based on
> authoritarian hierarchic institutions would tolerate such a school
> system for long. As Sam Bowles and Herb Gintis have pointed out, it 
> might be tolerated for the elite, because they would have to learn how
> to think and create and so on, but not for the mass of the
> population.   There are roles that the public schools play in society
> that can be very destructive.

# What was it like to attend the Seattle Quora meetup on October 24, 2014?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-to-attend-the-Seattle-Quora-meetup-on-October-24-2014)

I think the conversations that happened at
the meetup this time were a lot like those of past meetups. What made
this meetup unique was that we couldn't agree on a good place to meet,
so ended up talking outside of the RAM from 6:00pm to around 7:30(?)pm.
We ended up waiting in line for the RAM but there was difficulty
acquiring a table (the restaurant wanted to split the group into two
tables). I eventually had to leave before the group even got a table.

Some other notable points:

-   Everyone did manage to get the new Quora shirt.
-   There were several new people attending the meetup.
-   The group again did seem to mostly be people associated with UW.

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/Who-is-interested-in-an-effective-altruism-group-club-at-the-University-of-Washington/answer/Issa-Rice)


As the asker of this question, I am highly interested in such a group. I
don't have a lot of experience with effective altruism yet though. I
also don't have experience with typical leadership positions like in
high school clubs, so I'm not sure about trying to start it just on my
own—although I'd definitely be willing to give it a try. (But in any
case, if very few people are interested, then it might not be worth the
effort to attempt to start a group).

# How can I implement cool URIs with Hakyll?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-implement-cool-URIs-with-Hakyll/answer/Issa-Rice)


In the Hakyll configuration file, do something like `route $ setExtension ""`, which will remove the `.html` extension from the generated file.
See also the discussion at [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21msg/hakyll/XewxMLIjRIw/hBDnD3iXLMwJ).

Really, the main thing is to have the server set the default MIME type
to `text/html` so that these extensionless files are seen as valid HTML files by browsers.
Note that if you're hosting on something like GitHub pages, then this is not possible (see [Can MIME types of Github Pages files be configured?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15951012/can-mime-types-of-github-pages-files-be-configured)), which is why many people set up Jekyll/Hakyll to make separate directories for each page with an `index.html` in each so that the URLs will still look pretty (so you can go to both `example.com/page-name/` and `example.com/page-name/index.html`).

# Does Issa Rice watch anime?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/Does-Issa-Rice-watch-anime/answer/Issa-Rice)


Not anymore. When I was younger and lived in Japan, I used to watch
quite a bit (there are usually evening anime around 5pm–7pm in Japan,
and I used to watch several of those). I also remember being obsessed about [Digimon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digimon),
which used to (not sure if this is still true) come on around 9am 
on Sundays. In fact I was so obsessed that I got my parents to record
it onto videotapes every week (might still have those somewhere). I
remember being very upset once when we forgot to record it.

Other anime I remember watching: [Pokémon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon),
[Yakitate!! Japan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakitate%21%21_Japan), [Doraemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doraemon),
[Chibi Maruko-chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chibi_Maruko-chan),
学校の怪談, 名探偵コナン, あたしンち,
and [Sazae-san](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sazae-san).
(There probably are more.)

When I got older and moved to the US, I briefly got excited about [笑ゥせぇるすまん -
Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%AC%91%E3%82%A5%E3%81%9B%E3%81%87%E3%82%8B%E3%81%99%E3%81%BE%E3%82%93)
(Laughing Salesman), which has a fantastic depiction of a hedonistic
Japan.

I also remember liking [The Girl Who Leapt

film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_Who_Leapt_Through_Time_%282006_film%29).

# How often do you check the edit history to see the author of a question?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/How-often-do-you-check-the-edit-history-to-see-the-author-of-a-question/answer/Issa-Rice)

If the question is about someone on Quora, then I like to check who asked it. (This helps me build a better mental model of which Quora users like asking personal questions, like receiving them, etc., as well as letting me see which users interact with each other.)

If a question is particularly interesting or elaborately formulated, then I'm more inclined to check as well.

I'm less likely to check when I'm on the mobile app since I have to open an external browser to check.

As for how often this actually happens, I'd guess maybe once or twice a day.

Answering my own question since I figured it out. Indeed only the first
item seems to be bound to the variable, but using for-loops we can
obtain the other values as well. See [Listing tags using pandoc and YAML

For Japanese, there is [Knoh (ノウ) | The

to have around 60 answers on Quora translated (with the original answer
side-by-side, like [初めて起業するアントレプレナーたちが、もっともよくやってしまう過ちはなんですか？

the efforts of a small group of people, and there doesn't seem to be a
sign up feature, so I'm not sure how much it will expand. They do say on
[Knoh について | Knoh
(ノウ)](http://knoh.jp/about) that in the future they're planning
to publicly allow transaltions through the cloud. Also there does seem
to be a fairly active hashtag devoted to it on Twitter at [Twitter / Search -

# What does Issa Rice think of Andrew J. Ho's post-graduation plans?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/What-does-Issa-Rice-think-of-Andrew-J-Hos-post-graduation-plans/answer/Issa-Rice)


I'm not an expert on the subject, so I hope [Vipul
Naik](https://www.quora.com/Vipul-Naik) can provide a better
answer, but here are some thoughts.

-   Admittedly my first reaction was one of bewilderment, mostly because
    I don't know anyone (smart) who is even remotely interested in
    pursuing personal tutoring. I suppose I just hadn't considered this
    at all until now, which probably shows in this answer.
-   In general I seem to associate the test prep industry with
    compulsory schooling in the US in general, and my impression isn't
    very positive [1, 2]. I'm still split on the question of time
    allocation for high school students. [3] In general I'm a lot more
    interested in extremely long-term goals rather than relatively
    short-term ones, and I think test prep falls under the latter. I
    suppose if the opportunity is lucrative enough, then it might be
    worth it. [4]
-   I am however very much interested when you mention teaching more
    advanced topics. I sometimes wish there were local groups that
    extended Cognito Mentoring, and if your plan could evolve to
    accomplish that (while, say, paying for maintenance/development with
    donations and the money earned from doing test prep), then I'd be
    very interested.
-   Your description [5] of the local area is consistent with what I
    have observed, but again I'm not an expert.
-   I suppose I can evaluate your plans personally, and consider whether
    I would take a similar path, although even this is a bit difficult
    since I haven't even begun college yet: for myself, my relative lack
    of experience with standardized tests makes the prospect fall apart
    immediately, though I would consider helping high school students
    per the Cognito Mentoring plan given above.

=\=\=\=\=\
[1]\: See for example [Education
Disruption](http://education-disruption.quora.com). From what
I've observed, you seem to have similar views.

[2]\: On the other hand, Cognito Mentoring, for instance, takes a neutral
stance regarding [Standardized

During my own high school career, I tended to eschew studying for
standardized tests altogether. Still, one can ask whether, given that
students shouldn't spend time on test prep, whether one should still
seek a career in it to "extort money from the oblivious", or similar.

Then I added a new question with the exact wording of the old question,

# What is it like to attend the Friday pizza lunch on the astronomy floor at the University of Washington?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-attend-the-Friday-pizza-lunch-on-the-astronomy-floor-at-the-University-of-Washington/answer/Issa-Rice)


I went to one during the summer, so I'm not quite sure if the atmosphere
I experienced was usual. Essentially, someone goes out to buy three(?)
large pizzas[2] and some drinks (canned Coca Cola) and everyone else
pays \$2.50 a slice to eat.[1] Everyone sits or stands around in the
lounge (which is sort of more like a hallway with chairs), and chats a
bit. I think most of the people there were professors/researchers or
graduate students. I felt a bit out of place as I was one of the only
undergraduates/prefrosh. What I ended up doing was standing in the room
next to the lounge/hallway with [Kristin
Lie](https://www.quora.com/Kristin-Lie) and [Lilian
Liang](https://www.quora.com/Lilian-Liang).

If I end up going again, I'd like to (1) try talking to people about
astronomy/the astronomy major at UW/the astronomy research at UW; (2) go
during the regular school year to see if the summertime was unique; (3)
update this answer accordingly.


=\=\=\=\=\
[1]\: Although, for myself, I had brought lunch so I ate that instead of
the pizza.

[2]\: I did hear someone say that the pizza slices tend to run out fast,
although when I went there seemed to be (just) enough for everyone.

# What is it like to go to the UW A&O (for freshmen)?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-go-to-the-UW-A-O-for-freshmen/answer/Issa-Rice)


Some thoughts (from the 2014 A&O):

-   I am not convinced that the A&O required two days. The total time
    required to attend fully is 16.5 hours, and I felt that the
    important parts (getting one's Husky Card, signing up for classes,
    asking questions, getting to know some students) didn't really
    require this entire time. It almost felt like the university itself
    was not confident that students would stay, so had to implement
    measures to force students to stay the full time. (To illustrate,
    they didn't tell you the schedule for the second day on the first
    day, they scared students into coming on time on the second day[1],
    course registration was during the second day, and they didn't hand
    out the Husky Cards until the very end of the second day, even
    though photos were taken much earlier during that day.) One student
    in my particular group actually left after dinner on the first day.
-   I thought that a lot of the information could simply have been
    placed on the UW website for students to read[2], especially
    considering that most of the videos that were shown during the
    orientation are available on YouTube already.
-   Even though the A&O required so much time, I still felt that I
    didn't get enough time/support to register for courses. They
    allocated around 1–1.5 hours for registration, but I still felt
    rushed and actually didn't end up registering for any courses during
    the alloted time[3], mostly due to questions about prerequisites for
    majors, which math course to take, IB credits, honors courses, and
    so on. At least in the very beginning, I would have appreciated more
    extended individualized help. My wish would be that they had
    concentrated their efforts more into making sure each student got
    help instead of setting up some sort of "Husky experience" with a
    chain of presentations.[4]
-   The food/eating experience was pleasant, and much better than what I
    got during high school orientation. I appreciated the
    vegetarian/vegan accommodations.
-   The orientation leaders were extremely helpful. My particular
    orientation leader was a rising senior, so seemed to know a lot of
    things about UW. His anecdotes were rather helpful, and I was able
    to ask about e.g. taking graduate level courses and even what the
    conditions were for getting a free replacement for the Husky Card
    (in case it broke).[5]
-   I was in an honors group during the orientation, so was able to
    spend some time with peers who tended to be more high-achieving (on
    average), which perhaps helped me regarding socialization (e.g.
    having more common topics to discuss). I don't know if I was able to
    construct any "lasting friendships", but it was nonetheless pleasant
    to be in my group (of 17 people). I should mention that the
    university didn't bother to filter out students who were accepted
    into UW honors but declined; these students were forced to sit in
    for the honors presentations, and I felt bad for them.


=\=\=\=\=\
[1]\: The schedule pamphlet states "8:00am - Don't be late! Meet your
Orientation Leader at your group's designated location. Failure to
arrive on-time and check-in by 8:05am will result in a block on Autumn
course registration." In reality, they were pretty lax about this
requirement, staying until around 8:15am at the meeting spot.

[2]\: Perhaps included as part of the pre-registration screens, to force
students to read through them?

[3]\: I don't think this was usual; most people seemed to be able to get
their registration done/almost done.

[4]\: Perhaps I am being too bitter.

[5]\: I suppose one thing to keep in mind is that the orientation leaders
are paid, so they may be acting extremely helpfully to make people feel
welcomed. I personally did not mind their helpfulness/cheerfulness, and
thought they did a very good job.


# What is the dinner/lunch like at the UW freshmen A&O?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-dinner-lunch-like-at-the-UW-freshmen-A-O/answer/Issa-Rice)


From 2014:

-   Dinner (Day 1): A salad (from a huge salad bowl, so one can get an
    arbitrary amount), (canned?) oranges, some sort of stir fry (there
    was a vegetarian stir fry as well, which one could ask for at the
    kitchen), rice. We ate at the ball room in the HUB.
-   Lunch (Day 2): I think all the groups split off into different
    locations (possibly because of the problem Jennifer mentioned),
    although there were multiple groups in my location. Our group ate at
    [Local Point in Lander
    Hall](https://www.hfs.washington.edu/localpoint/), where it
    was, as Jennifer noted, a buffet-style lunch. (Vegetarian options
    were available; I had a salad and a vegetarian plate with random
    food on it.)


# What is it like to have Vipul Naik as a teacher?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-have-Vipul-Naik-as-a-teacher/answer/Issa-Rice)


I'm answering because Vipul asked me to, but I don't primarily consider him a teacher.
I first contacted him when he began Cognito Mentoring with
Jonah Sinick, so I still think of our relation as being one of
mentor–mentee.

On Quora, he helpfully answers some of my questions like [What are the common frustrations of Vipul Naik?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-common-frustrations-of-Vipul-Naik)
(which I asked because I was feeling curious after I saw one that was
asked of Alex K. Chen) and [Does Vipul Naik cook?](https://www.quora.com/Does-Vipul-Naik-cook) (which I asked because I became curious about vegetarianism/veganism).
However this is rather typical of Quora in general (e.g. I ask more questions about Alex K. Chen than about Vipul).

On Facebook, I know him as the most sedulous article collector and
discussion initiator/moderator. I suppose this is somewhat the role
teachers usually fill, by introducing material to the class. He seems to
do this better in some sense, then, by mostly bringing up discussion
topics that are of interest to me, and also by not forcing people to
contribute (which is what a traditional teacher does through verbal
remarks and grades).

He also personally tells me things e.g. to join LinkedIn or to check out
Power Smoothies, but again this applies to a greater class of people
than that of just teachers.

\

I was reminded (by Vipul) that I have also watched some of his math videos on YouTube.
I thought these were high quality, and especially interesting
since they went into more abstract topics than the typical math videos
one finds online (e.g. Khan academy).
More recently, I watched his videos on proving limits using the epsilon–delta definition (available as a playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smP5NIYsvPc&list=PLC0bHnWu122lmEcvTXAnTbb33-faiCY1E)).
I thought the videos were good, and more detailed than what my math class did in college (at the same level).
I didn't like that he already had the delta beforehand instead of using "scratch work" like many others do (although the algebraic computations do make it rather obvious what to choose for delta).
When I asked about this, he was also willing to point out a few more things, like how the choice of delta was related to the derivative of the function.
I wish he had another video explaining this, though it's understandable that at the introductory stage this sort of thing isn't discussed.


# University of Washington: Why do the computers in the undergrad astro lab only have Scientific Linux with Python 2.4?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/University-of-Washington/Why-do-the-computers-in-the-undergrad-astro-lab-only-have-Scientific-Linux-with-Python-2-4/answer/Issa-Rice)


The astro lab recently updated to Scientific Linux 6, along with Python
2.6 and Vim 7.2, so some more features may be working.

\=\=\=\=\=

**Update**: Actually if you use something like `/astro/apps6/anaconda2.0/bin/python` instead of the default installation of Python (`/usr/bin/python`), [1] then you can use Python 2.7.8 as of August 2014. The other
advantage of using the Python on Anaconda is that you get software like
[Astropy](http://www.astropy.org/)
and [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
without having to install them yourself.

[1]\: Since the astro admins install [Anaconda Scientific Python

# What was it like to attend the Seattle Quora meetup on June 27th, 2014?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-to-attend-the-Seattle-Quora-meetup-on-June-27th-2014/answer/Issa-Rice)


Some thoughts:

-   In terms of the venue, Tutta Bella had good food (although I felt
    bad for Alex K. Chen) but was a bit too noisy for conversing
    comfortably. I often found myself leaning toward whoever was
    speaking just so I could hear them.
-   It was really nice to have Hao there, because he would be able to
    give insight to things that only someone at Quora would know (e.g.
    that Quora is considering revising its "walled-garden" approach, and
    that this issue is somewhat contentious). I had been to two previous
    meet ups, and these tended to be more decentralized, but since Hao
    was there he in some sense took the role of "leader" e.g. by
    introducing himself to anyone who came later, or by managing the
    payment at the end.
-   I felt that the conversation topics were more varied, probably due
    to the higher turnout (compared to the other meetups I have been
    to). For instance there was a conversation near the end about the
    "Seattle freeze", and it was nice to see that the conversation could
    transition to even local things.
-   There were quite a few top writers there, so hearing some stories
    about the top writers' conference was fun (e.g. everyone clapping
    for Alex K. Chen before he asked a question).

  {% if page.tags contains "math" %}
    for math and not japanese
  {% endif %}
{% endunless %}

{% unless page.tags contains "math" %}

# How long has Issa Rice used Linux for?

**\~5 years.**

I started with Ubuntu (either Intrepid (Oct 2008) or Jaunty (Apr 2009))
after I got my own computer (a very old Gateway machine); at first I
dual-booted with Windows XP. Even as far back as 2005/2006, however, I

sort of like [What does Richard Stallman

# Who is interested in a May 2014 Quora meetup in Seattle?

# As a high school student, how have you found reading and participating on Quora useful?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/As-a-high-school-student-how-have-you-found-reading-and-participating-on-Quora-useful/answer/Issa-Rice)


Some thoughts:

-   Reading about people's experiences in college has been immensely
    useful, especially since there don't seem to be other good
    systematic ways to elicit such information and make it public. Quora
    seems particularly good at spreading everything from random
    anecdotes about a teacher to general opinion about a major at a
    university to study habits, and so on. I'm also lucky that the
    school I will be attending already has a lot of questions/answers on
    Quora, so I get a "head start", in a way. See [Vipul Naik's answer to For what
    universities does Quora have the most information and
    why?](https://www.quora.com/For-what-universities-does-Quora-have-the-most-information-and-why/answer/Vipul-Naik)
    for more.
-   This is more general, but there are some amazing answers on Quora,
    which I am unsure I can find anywhere else. See e.g. [Mark Eichenlaub's answer to Do grad school
    students remember everything they were taught in college all the
    time?](https://www.quora.com/Do-grad-school-students-remember-everything-they-were-taught-in-college-all-the-time/answer/Mark-Eichenlaub)
-   Other websites I tend to be interested in (e.g. Less Wrong) are more
    intimidating, which makes contribution more difficult for high
    school students like me. Quora is more tolerant of my random
    interests. (See e.g. [Is the
    popularity of multi-colored carrots proportional to the diversity of
    ethnicities of a
    country?](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-popularity-of-multi-colored-carrots-proportional-to-the-diversity-of-ethnicities-of-a-country))
    I don't see the Stack Exchange network ever allowing me to ask that.
-   It's also probably easier to get upvotes on Quora than on Less
    Wrong, so there is perhaps more motivation to post here because of
    that.

# What is the longest question on Quora?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-longest-question-on-Quora/answer/Issa-Rice)

I just found [In today’s hyper-fast
business world, we watch startups like Groupon go from zero to billions
seemingly overnight.  It’s tempting to measure ourselves by these
examples and to feel wholly inadequate. Personally, I have to wonder:
Why isn’t my businesses growing as fast as these new-age juggernauts?
What am I doing wrong? Why the 'New Normal' Isn't  The truth is,
Groupon-style growth is neither normal nor sustainable, and no “normal”
company should worry about emulating it. The reason for this is
two-fold:  Without VC money to flush down the toilet, you must fund you
own growth  Your funding is mathematically limited by actual profits.
Let'stake a closer look at this simple logic. Calculating Sustainable
Growth  Normal companies are profitable, not venture-funded. Not all
businesses are venture funded (thank God), and not all entrepreneurs
want to sell their souls to a VC. Although VC money powers rapid growth,
99.9% of companies will never see a dime of VC investment.  I’m guessing
that your “normal” company is not funded by VC and instead relies on
profits to fuel growth. (Groupon, meanwhile, has burned through almost a
billion dollars of venture capital.) Profitable companies have limits...
Believe it or not, growth is naturally limited in a profitable company
that is not venture-funded. Big companies figured this out decades ago.
In fact, Hewlett Packard pioneered the term “Affordable Growth Rate” to
describe the maximum speed of growth at HP in the 1950s. HP's Affordable
Growth Rate formula is a good (and easy to calculate) method that any
profitable company can use. ...And that limit is the Affordable Growth
Rate. Your Affordable Growth Rate (AGR) is the percentage that your
sales can grow year over year. If your sales doubled, that’s 100 percent
growth – that much is simple. But sales growth is limited by your
ability to fund new sales.  So -- how fast can your business grow?
Calculate your maximum AGR by dividing this year’s net profits by last
year's equity. [More specifically, AGR = (this year’s after tax retained
profits) / (Stockholders' tangible equity at the end of last year).]
Hewlett  Packard used this equation to limit its own growth. Yes, that’s
right, they wanted to limit growth.  Why?Because growing sales faster
than the rest of your business is a sure way toget yourself into
financial trouble. HP knew that sales have to be financed(computers have
to be built, sales people paid, etc.), and financing comeseither from
your own assets (cash) or what you can borrow against those assets
(loans). Sustainable Growth Is Good Growth  There’s no magic formula for
unlimited growth in a normal company. In fact, just the opposite. Your
AGR is a rather good formula (perhaps not magic) to show why growth
should be limited. You can only grow as fast as your profits (and equity
growth) allow. Not even Groupon can change the fundamentals of
sustainable growth. (And a few rational investors have seen this in
their analysis of the Groupon IPO.) So whether you make lunch boxes or
machine tools, websites or weed-whackers, take note. Make your best
effort to grow – just be sure that the growth is sustainable by sticking
to your AGR limits. Dedicated to your (Growing!) profits,  David  By:

# Why do Quora blogs have URLs that are subdomains and subdirectories?

[Mirror](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Quora-blogs-have-URLs-that-are-subdomains-and-subdirectories/answer/Issa-Rice)

**For blogs with a subdomain URL**

1.  Go to the corner (on full web version) of the page with your name.
    (Hover over your name.)
2.  Click on "Create Blog".
3.  The URL will automatically assume the style http://blogname.quora.com.

Interestingly, going to either http://quora.com/yourusername/blogname or http://quora.com/blogname will redirect you to the same blog.
However the blog identifier here must be unique in all of Quora, so one does not have the freedom to choose an arbitrary name.

**For blogs with subdirectory URL**

(I actually haven't found a direct way to do this, and the current
method seems like a hack...)

1. Go to a random Quora post/answer/question.
2. Click on "Share" at the bottom of the post/answer/question.
3. Check the box that says "Post to Blog".
4. Type in any name for a blog.
5. Click on "Create Blog". (This assumes that you don't already have a
    blog with this name.)
6. Now the URL assumes the style http://quora.com/yourusername/blogname.
7. Now one can post to this blog like any other blog.
