This is my course review for CSE 351, hardware/software interface.
I took the course in Winter 2016 with Dan Grossman.

# Notes

As with the other courses I'm taking this quarter, I've decided to keep notes while I'm taking the course instead of writing a review afterwards.

So far I've been extremely frustrated with the amount of low-level details I've had to deal with. The justification given for this course is that even though we won't ever use this, it's still good to know because it'll give us a better understanding of what goes on "under the hood". However personally I don't find this very convincing.

Some of the assignments, like lab 1, involve tediously limiting what we can use to solve the problems, which was extremely annoying.
