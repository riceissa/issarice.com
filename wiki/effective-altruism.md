[Effective altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism) (EA) is "a philosophy and social movement which applies evidence and reason to determining the most effective ways to improve the world".
On this page I describe my personal involvement with and thoughts on EA.

# Personal involvement

I've been involved with the effective altruism community for some time.
I first heard about EA through [LessWrong]() (I think it was a post about GiveWell), probably in 2011 or 2012.
I remember reading [Holden Karnofsky's critique of the Singularity Institute](http://lesswrong.com/lw/cbs/thoughts_on_the_singularity_institute_si/) (now [MIRI](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Machine_Intelligence_Research_Institute)) right when it came out (May 2012), and I remember it reaching the status of "most upvoted LW post ever".
Although I was [intellectually in agreement with effective altruism](https://www.quora.com/As-someone-who-is-intellectually-in-agreement-with-effective-altruism-but-hasnt-started-earning-money-of-my-own-how-can-I-best-contribute-to-the-Effective-Altruism-Forum), I didn't actually do anything about it, thinking that working hard in school would be a form of altruism (i.e. that in the long term, working hard in school and having more opportunities would allow me to best contribute to the world).

In January 2014, I contacted [Cognito Mentoring]() for the first time.
Although I myself didn't seem to ask directly about EA (looking back at our correspondence), a friend contacted them regarding effective career choice, and this roused my interested in effective altruism as well.

In [July 2014, I attended a Seattle Effective Altruists meetup](https://www.facebook.com/events/266352430227314/); although I didn't contribute much to the discussion, my interest in EA increased.
Part of the reason I attended was due to my interest, but part of it too was
that I was working on a research project at the University of Washington over
the summer, and the July meetup was conveniently situated next to campus -- so
the activation energy to attend had been considerably lowered.
The topic of the meetup was also "Donating vs. Working directly for impact",
which was a topic of particular interest to me going into college.

Following my first meetup was a period of several months where I frequently attended Seattle EA meetups.
I also became more involved in online discussions of EA, and eventually in November 2014 started the [Cause Prioritization Wiki](http://causeprioritization.org/) as a place to store my research on [cause prioritization]().
Also around this time, I tried to start an [effective altruism group at the University of Washington](https://www.facebook.com/groups/EffectiveAltruismUW).
The group didn't get much traction, and as of August 2016, it had only had one
meetup in November 2014.
During the 2016--2017 school year, Rohin Shah and Ethan Bashkansky restarted
the group, with meetings taking place throughout the school year.
I have attended multiple meetings but have played only a minor role in this
revival.
As of the following school year, the group seems to be dead again.

I continue to be involved in online discussions of EA, but have since become much less involved in Seattle EA meetups.

From March 2016 or so to May 2017, I did more concentrated work in global health, working with [Vipul Naik](https://vipulnaik.com/).
As part of this work, I made several [Wikipedia pages related to global health](wikipedia#global-health).

Starting in May 2017, I've been working (again with Vipul) on broader topics
including infrastructure and economic growth.

# Beliefs

My thoughts on the EA movement have gone through several revisions over
the years.

Initially, probably during **2011--2013**, EA was merely a curiosity and I
was either a person who had only heard about it or at most a "lurker".
(I was more interested in LessWrong/rationality than helping the world
specifically.)

The next phase, during **2014--2015**, is when I became most excited
about EA, attending meetups and consuming a lot of the "standard"
texts and learning the standard arguments in the movement.

The next phase, during **2016** or so, is when my view of EA became
more refined and somewhat negative. I started to think that while the
movement had a lot of interesting people associated with it, the
_most_ interesting/smart people tended to be on the _periphery of EA_
(without necessarily calling themselves "effective altruists") rather
than directly involved in it at the center, and that most of the
"intellectual work" was being done by a few of the "top" people. Under
this view, there were a few [Serious
People](https://equilibriabook.com/molochs-toolbox/) associated with
the EA movement, but the vast majority of people who associated with
the movement were
[followers](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2005/05/motivating_shee.html)/promoters
more than originators of ideas.

I also started to think that EA uses a [clever definition](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/df/the_outside_critics_of_effective_altruism/26u) to make it irrefutable in some sense, which makes discussion and criticism of it difficult.

The general feeling was that maybe effective altruism just does to
philanthropy what [Bastiat does to
economics](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/08/the_subtle_valu.html)
(and [EA might not even be as new as I used to
think](is-effective-altruism-new)).

Then, during **2017--2018**, I somewhat revised my previous thinking
(or rather, how I felt about what I already believed). Looking outside
of my filter bubble, I reflected more on how people outside the
EA/rationality sphere often could not even parse basic arguments, and
how they seemed oblivious to ideas that I considered obvious
(e.g. standard EA talking points, some things in the
[_Sequences_](https://www.readthesequences.com/)).

It is still true that I've only been consistently impressed with a few
people associated with the movement, but that no longer felt like such
a bad thing. To have a movement where the vast majority of people
cannot not generate interesting ideas but where at least they could
follow tricky arguments started to seem remarkable rather than
disappointing.

Overall, I'm not comfortable considering myself part of the "EA
movement". However, I'm happy to consider myself an "effective
altruist" in the sense of "someone who spends a lot of time trying to
figure out how to best help the world" and to interact and collaborate
with people who do consider themselves part of the movement.
