This is my course review for MATH 335, Advanced Calculus.
This is the second quarter of the MATH 33X sequence, which started with [MATH 334]().
I took the course in Winter 2016 with James Morrow and teaching-assistant Will Dana.

# Notes

Here I'll keep some observations of the course as I go along.

- The first two weeks have been just a lot of computations. I'm not sure I'm
  gaining a lot of understanding so far. Also apparently our class is
  currently a few weeks behind of last year's class.
- I'm getting more and more frustrated that I'm having to spend so much time
  on math, when I consider some of the other activities I do, like [Wikipedia
  editing](wikipedia) to be of higher value.
- When it comes to the divergence theorem and Stokes's theorem, and other
  multi-dimensional ideas, I really feel like Folland's book doesn't contain
  enough illustrations.
