This is my course review for MATH 335, Advanced Calculus.
This is the second quarter of the MATH 33X sequence, which started with [MATH 334]().
I took the course in Winter 2016 with James Morrow and teaching-assistant Will Dana.

# Notes

Here I'll keep some observations of the course as I go along.

- The first two weeks have been just a lot of computations. I'm not sure I'm
  gaining a lot of understanding so far. Also apparently our class is
  currently a few weeks behind of last year's class.
- I'm getting more and more frustrated that I'm having to spend so much time
  on math, when I consider some of the other activities I do, like [Wikipedia
  editing](wikipedia) to be of higher value.
- When it comes to the divergence theorem and Stokes's theorem, and other
  multi-dimensional ideas, I really feel like Folland's book doesn't contain
  enough illustrations.

From 7th week:

- I'm getting frustrated once again with the time it takes to type up
  problem sets. I think that almost all the learning comes from just
  doing the problems, so typing up solutions just so it's legible and
  coherent to the grader isn't actually helping *me* learn anything.
  This is one of the big differences I see from high school math.  An
  annoying bug that comes with college-level proof-based math courses is
  the emphasis on having homework that is clearly laid out. In high
  school, math problems were mostly computational, which made them
  boring, but it was also acceptable to present just scratch work
  instead of coherent thought processes (indeed, homework was always
  completion-based and not actually graded for correctness[^hw]).
- Besides the point-set topology in [334](math-334) and some of the
  basics of analysis (which I had learned on my own in high school),
  there hasn't really been any math in 334/335 that I could call
  "beautiful". In fact, it's a bit tiring to do problems week after week
  that are, in effect, *factory-produced*; they are problems written not
  for intrinsic value, but rather *simply to be solved*. In other words,
  these problems are not the sort of "beautiful" or "interesting"
  problems that one would *naturally* gravitate toward (the sort of
  problems that are merely and divinely *present* because of their
  inherent value, and meant to be solved by "elites"), but rather
  something mass-produced, to be consumed by the "mathematical masses"
  (which are a minority with respect to the general population), or
  written due to the practical desire to *evalute students*. These
  problems are in fact no different from whiteboard interview question
  in programming, which have been criticized well elsewhere[^whiteboard].

[^hw]: This is something I see in other subjects as well. High school
tests and projects were graded, but daily/weekly assignments were often
graded solely on completion (possibly because there was usually only one
teacher who couldn't possibly have graded everything each day), whereas
in college even weekly problem sets are graded (and still account for a
nontrivial portion of the final grade).

[^whiteboard]: See in particular [Raman Shah's answer to "I'm doing a
computational physics PhD. Is working as a software engineer really a
viable option after I
graduate?"](https://www.quora.com/Im-doing-a-computational-physics-PhD-Is-working-as-a-software-engineer-really-a-viable-option-after-I-graduate/answer/Raman-Shah), which contains:
