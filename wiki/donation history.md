My donation history begins in 2015 because that is the year during which I first started working/earning money that could be considered "my own".

# 2015

I earned around $2,000 doing mostly content creation work under Vipul Naik.
I did not donate in 2015 because I am still [building a financial buffer](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-good-amount-of-financial-buffer-to-have-for-a-single-male/answer/Vipul-Naik).

# 2016

I earned around [$9,700][cw] (not counting deferred payments) working under
Vipul Naik.

# 2017

I earned around \$34,000 [ETA: this ended up being more like \$37,000 due to
tasks from 2017 being added to Vipul's Contract Work website in January--March
2018]. This amount includes the \$9,360 deferred payment from
last year. My main source of income was [contract work][cw] for Vipul Naik. I also
did some contract work for Peter Hurford (recorded on Vipul Naik's contract
work site) and sold leftover bitcoin that I had (worth around $250).

In addition, Vipul Naik offered me $500 to donate to a charity of my choice
(kind of a bonus for working for him all year).

I decided not to donate in 2017 (both with my own money and Vipul's offer,
which I deferred to a later time) due to a combination of (1) uncertainty about
my understanding of the world; and (2) continuing to build a financial buffer
(which is a smaller priority now that I've crossed the [$30k threshold](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-good-amount-of-financial-buffer-to-have-for-a-single-male/answer/Vipul-Naik)).

# 2018

I earned around $18,000. Like last year, my main source of income was [contract
work][cw] for Vipul Naik. I also wrote a [timeline of the Future of Humanity
Institute](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Future_of_Humanity_Institute),
which was funded by Alex Flint.

In addition, like last year, Vipul Naik offered me an additional $500 to donate
to a charity of my choice.

I decided to take up Vipul's offer this year, using both last year's and this
year's amount (so a total of $1,000). I chose the following allocation:

- \$500 to Machine Intelligence Research Institute (with an additional $500 from
  REG's Double Up Drive). This was mostly intended as
  a [retrospective
  donation](https://causeprioritization.org/Analogs_in_the_non-profit_world_of_for-profit_ideas),
  as thanks for producing useful content and ideas, and for doing work that I
  consider useful in the AI safety space. As of late 2018, for prospective
  funding, I do share [concerns about MIRI's new nondisclosure-by-default
  policy](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a72owS5hz3acBK5xc/2018-ai-alignment-literature-review-and-charity-comparison)
  and also think that its "room for more funding" may not be as great as in the
  past (the latter is sort of hard to assess due to the former).
- \$500 to the [$500k block donor
  lottery](https://app.effectivealtruism.org/lotteries/63715163508813), hosted
  by Centre for Effective Altruism. After watching the donor lottery for the
  first two years, I felt comfortable about giving to it. The donor lottery
  seemed like a good choice given my general uncertainties about the world.

Some other things I considered but didn't end up choosing:

- EA Funds (especially the Long-Term Future Fund). Since the fund managers
  changed only recently, I decided I want to continue watching their activity.
- Donating to certain "woke individuals". There are maybe around four
  individuals at the intersection of (1) people I consider especially
  smart/"woke"/"have good world models", and (2) people who don't seem to have
  access to a bunch of resources with which to implement their "vision" (sorry
  if this language is too vague). I decided to skip this and continue thinking
  about it for the following reasons: (1) These people don't generally
  advertise a need for funding; and (2) I don't want to make my future interactions
  with them awkward by offering them money.
- Upcoming AI safety people. In principle I would like to fund some early-stage
  AI safety people, but in practice I found that (1) I don't know any of them
  well; (2) some of them are pseudonymous; (3) they are generally not anywhere
  near as transparent as I would like them to be. These factors made assessment
  difficult, so I decided to skip this and keep watching the space.

I decided to not donate any of my own money as I am now reducing my contract
work hours in order to do something about AI safety (so I might actually need
to use some of my savings for something).

Besides the donations listed above, Vipul also gave another donation on the
same day (that he chose himself); you can read about that donation in the [post
he wrote about his 2018
donations](https://vipulnaik.com/blog/my-2018-donations/).

# 2019

I earned around $5,000. Like the previous
years, my main source of income was [contract work][cw] for Vipul Naik. I also
did some contract work for BERI. (There were also some smaller sources of
income, but I won't bother to list them all.)

I decided not to donate in 2019. This is mainly for two reasons:

Personal finances
:    I worked very little this year, so my income is small. My
     future income is also uncertain at this point, so I might need to use my
     savings in the future.

Low value of small marginal donations to targets I am most interested in funding
:    I am currently most excited about funding independent AI safety
     researchers and small projects (in AI safety and some other areas). My best
     guess is that funding these individuals or projects to a point where there
     are significant counterfactual differences requires at least around \$50,000
     (amount calculated based on paying one researcher who doesn't require a lot
     of money for one year). As far as I know, there isn't a simple way to
     coordinate with other people interested in funding independent researchers,
     so I can't just say something like "I pledge to give $1,000 to person X if
     enough other people also pledge to do the same" and have all the logistics
     taken care of. The best alternatives to do this sort of coordination to fund
     independent researchers at the moment seem to be EA Funds' Long-Term Future
     Fund and the EA Hotel; I think these are decent options but I prefer having
     more control over what gets funded.

# 2020

I earned around $10,000.

- I started giving $5 per month to Andy Matuschak's Patreon account (\$35 total over the course of the year, as I started partway through the year). While I do think this work is valuable, I started giving mostly for selfish reasons of wanting to see more of Andy's output, so I don't consider this a donation calculated to maximize impact on the world.
- I gave \$10 total to MIRI as bounty payment (i.e. someone completed a bounty I put out, and this person requested I donate to MIRI rather than paying them).

Otherwise I did not donate, for basically the same reasons as 2019 (though the details have changed slightly).

# 2021

I earned around $15,000 (or more precisely, I received around $15,000 during the year, which is my income for tax purposes, but not all of that amount has been "earned").

- I continued giving $5 per month to Andy Matuschak's Patreon account.

Otherwise I did not donate, for basically the same reasons as in 2019.
