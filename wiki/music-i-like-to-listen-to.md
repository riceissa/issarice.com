This was originally written as an answer to the Quora question "[What music does Issa Rice listen to?](!q)"

I mostly listen to mainstream Western music from a few decades back: Bob Dylan, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, The Kinks, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Velvet Underground (roughly in that order).
I've also fairly recently discovered [Fishmans](!w), [Sidi Touré](!w), [Detektivbyrån](!w), [Jean Michel Jarre](!w), [Jean-Luc Ponty](!w), mostly through my father.

I also like some simple Japanese songs like [ゴンドラの唄](!wja) ([Gondola no Uta](!w)), [Aogeba Tōtoshi](!w) and [赤とんぼ (童謡)](!wja) (Red Dragonfly).
I also like João Gilberto's Chega De Saudade (even though I've never bothered to look up any of the lyrics) and Antonio Carlos Jobim's Stone Flower.

I do sometimes wonder why I don't listen as much to Japanese music.
It may be that since I've spent all my teenage years (when I first got interested in listening to music) in the US, my musical tastes were influenced that way.

I'm open to suggestions (e.g. sometimes [Kristin Lie](https://www.quora.com/Kristin-Lie) will show me a song), but I feel I've mostly discovered what I like, so I don't spend time actively searching for new things to listen to.
Finding more Japanese songs I like would be especially nice though.

I should also mention that I can go for long periods (weeks) without listening to any music.
It might just be that my collection is so small I get bored of it quickly, but can come back to it after some amount of time has passed.

Some others:

- "Dream A Little Dream of Me"---Ella Fitzgerald, Doris Day
- Taylor Swift---"Blank Space", "22", "Back to December"
