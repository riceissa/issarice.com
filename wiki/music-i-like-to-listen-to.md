[^kinks]: I really enjoy Ray Davies' cynical worldview.
See songs like "Sitting in my Hotel", "Supersonic Rocket Ship" (I read this as an indictment of modernity's populism/PC culture: "Nobody's gonna travel second class / There'll be equality / And no suppression of minorities"), "Celluloid Heroes", "Waterloo Sunset" (okay, this one is just sweet), "Apeman", "Autumn Almanac", "Little Miss Queen Of Darkness", "People Take Pictures of Each Other", "The Hard Way", "Afternoon Tea", "Wonderboy", "I'm On An Island".

I also like some simple Japanese songs like [ゴンドラの唄](!wja) ([Gondola no Uta](!w)), [Aogeba Tōtoshi](!w) and [赤とんぼ (童謡)](!wja) (Red Dragonfly).

I also like João Gilberto's [*Chega de Saudade* album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chega_de_Saudade_(album)) (even though I've never bothered to look up any of the lyrics besides the title track's) and Antonio Carlos Jobim's [*Stone Flower*](!w Stone Flower (album)).
I'm a huge fan of the Bossa Nova Japanification Project ([ボサノヴァ日本語化計画](http://hiyokomame.com/ottnet/bossa/translation.htm)).

I do sometimes wonder why I don't listen as much to Japanese music.
It may be that since I've spent all my teenage years (when I first got interested in listening to music) in the US, my musical tastes were influenced that way.

I'm open to suggestions (e.g. sometimes [Kristin Lie](https://www.quora.com/Kristin-Lie) will show me a song), but I feel I've mostly discovered what I like, so I don't spend time actively searching for new things to listen to.
Finding more Japanese songs I like would be especially nice though.

I should also mention that I can go for long periods (weeks) without listening to any music.
It might just be that my collection is so small I get bored of it quickly, but can come back to it after some amount of time has passed.

Some others:

- "Dream A Little Dream of Me"---Ella Fitzgerald, Doris Day
- Taylor Swift---"Blank Space", "22", "Back to December", "The Way I Loved You", "Forever and Always", "Ours", "Red", "Our Song"
- [Put Your Records On](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/corinnebaileyrae/putyourrecordson.html) by Corinne Bailey Rae
- Neon Genesis Evangelion OST
- Wings Of Honneamise OST
- "She's 22" by Norah Jones
- RahXephon OST (the classical tracks)
- Hyouka OST
- Hilary Hahn (via Andrew Ho)
- Pokemon OSTs, in particular the Ruby and Sapphire OST

(I plan to make a table like the following to better keep track of my music.
For me, music often allows me to experience the *qualia* of certain periods of my life, so it's important that the time periods when I listened to the music are listed alongside it.)

# History

This was originally written as an answer to the Quora question "[What music does Issa Rice listen to?](!q)"

The page started out as a collection of music I like to listen to, but considering that my tastes have drifted with the passing of time, I felt it more appropriate to make it a list of music I at one point in time liked listening to.
