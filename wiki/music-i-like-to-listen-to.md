This was originally written as an answer to the Quora question "[What music does Issa Rice listen to?](!q)"

I mostly listen to mainstream Western music from a few decades back: Bob Dylan^["Bob Dylan's 115th Dream", "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)", "Visions of Johanna", "Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again", "Just Like a Woman", "Subterranean Homesick Blues", "Mr. Tambourine Man", "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue", "I Want You",  "Highway 61 Revisited", "Ballad of a Thin Man", and many more.], The Beatles, Pink Floyd, The Kinks[^kinks], Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Velvet Underground (roughly in that order).
I've also fairly recently discovered [Fishmans](!w)^["頼りない天使", "バックビートにのっかって", and also their later albums: *空中キャンプ*, *宇宙 日本 世田谷*, *ORANGE*.], [Sidi Touré](!w), [Detektivbyrån](!w), [Jean Michel Jarre](!w), [Jean-Luc Ponty](!w), mostly through my father.

[^kinks]: I really enjoy Ray Davies' cynical worldview.
See songs like "Sitting in my Hotel", "Supersonic Rocket Ship" (I read this as an indictment of modernity's populism/PC culture: "Nobody's gonna travel second class / There'll be equality / And no suppression of minorities"), "Waterloo Sunset" (okay, this one is just sweet), "Apeman", "Autumn Almanac", "Little Miss Queen Of Darkness", "People Take Pictures of Each Other".

I also like some simple Japanese songs like [ゴンドラの唄](!wja) ([Gondola no Uta](!w)), [Aogeba Tōtoshi](!w) and [赤とんぼ (童謡)](!wja) (Red Dragonfly).
I also like João Gilberto's Chega De Saudade (even though I've never bothered to look up any of the lyrics) and Antonio Carlos Jobim's Stone Flower.

I do sometimes wonder why I don't listen as much to Japanese music.
It may be that since I've spent all my teenage years (when I first got interested in listening to music) in the US, my musical tastes were influenced that way.

I'm open to suggestions (e.g. sometimes [Kristin Lie](https://www.quora.com/Kristin-Lie) will show me a song), but I feel I've mostly discovered what I like, so I don't spend time actively searching for new things to listen to.
Finding more Japanese songs I like would be especially nice though.

I should also mention that I can go for long periods (weeks) without listening to any music.
It might just be that my collection is so small I get bored of it quickly, but can come back to it after some amount of time has passed.

Some others:

- "Dream A Little Dream of Me"---Ella Fitzgerald, Doris Day
- Taylor Swift---"Blank Space", "22", "Back to December", "The Way I Loved You", "Forever and Always", "Ours", "Red", "Our Song"
