This page lists publicly-available non-grant funding information of the [Open
Philanthropy Project](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/).
As of April 2017 I am not aware of any central location for this information
(other than this page).

Carl Shulman has stated that he does ["significant consulting for Open
Phil"](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/15g/small_donors_can_plan_to_make_better_bets_than/).
Carl seems good about disclosing this information when he weighs in on Open
Phil-related topics in public comments, but details of this contract work have
not been publicly disclosed (as far as I am aware).

Ben Soskis's work on the history of philanthropy is financially covered (fully?
partly?) by Open Phil; see the [history of philanthropy
page](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/history-of-philanthropy#Other_work_weve_commissioned)
and the footnote:

> This work is structured as part of Ben's consulting for us rather than as a
> grant, which is why it does not appear in our grants database.

Julia Galef's [Update Project](https://juliagalef.com/update-project/) is
financially covered by Open Phil:

> My time and expenses for this project are covered by a contract with the Open
> Philanthropy Project.

David Roodman [used to be an independent consultant](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/david-roodman)
for Open Phil, but "He became an employee in 2015".
