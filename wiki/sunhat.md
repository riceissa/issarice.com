After seeing Alex K. Chen with a sunhat, and recalling how annoying I often find the sun, I decided to buy one myself.
Having used it for around one year now in Seattle, I've found that it is excellent not just in blocking the sun but also against rain.
In contrast to hoodies, which constrain movement and block one's vision toward the back, the sunhat does neither, so I feel safer walking around in Seattle.
Mine has a string that loops around the chin, which makes removal easy once I am indoors; indeed, I can just leave the hat hanging behind my neck and only place it in my backpack when I settle down (to study, to eat).

Some other salient features of the sunhat: it is light to carry and dries quickly.
