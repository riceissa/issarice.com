One of the things that excited me about the Physics Girl livestream was the breakfast pancakes that she eats every day. With my own illness, I've had to limit the foods I eat too (though not as much as Physics Girl), so I've been interested in finding foods that might work well for me and taste good. The pancakes are apparently delicious, so much so that even her husband Kyle eats them every day.

Kyle said in the livestream that "we'll have to post a recipe later for people at home to try", but as far as I know the recipe was never published. So this is an unofficial recipe, to make it easy for me to try making them.

# Ingredients

Amounts were never mentioned in the stream, so I am purely guessing based on camera footage. I will try to update this later if/when I try making the pancakes myself.

- whole pistachios -- probably about 1/4 to 1/2 cup?
- fresh vanilla bean -- 1/2 tsp?
- pink lady apple -- 1.5 apples
- water -- just enough to get the consistency of the batter right
- ground chia seeds -- 2 tbsp?
- pecans (probably; it was in a different glass jar than the pistachios but were never called out in the live stream; later in the stream they mention that she eats pecans, whereas no other nuts were mentioned as far as I can tell) -- 1/4 cup?
- carrot -- 1 small
- coconut oil -- 1 tbsp?

# Directions

Blend the pistachios, vanilla bean, 1 pink lady apple (with skin on), and water. Set aside some of this for later to put on the pancakes as sauce, while most of it will be used as part of the batter.

Mix the ground chia seeds and pecans into the batter.

Peel and grate the carrot and mix the carrot and the rest of the apple chunks (half of an apple's worth) into the batter.

Turn on the stove, put a frying pan on top, and heat the coconut oil. Then add the batter in as small pancakes and fry them. Flip over after a couple minutes. Keep flipping and cooking until they are crispy and cooked through. Serve with the sauce.
