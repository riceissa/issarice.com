Some vaguely related threads about perfectionism, short term vs long term, etc.

- math psets: "easy to do, hard to write up"
- computer security; user [solipsist](http://lesswrong.com/user/solipsist/overview/) [comments](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/mi3/open_thread_jul_20_jul_26_2015/cljq):

    > The market doesn't support secure software. The expensive part
    > isn't writing the software -- it's inspecting for defects
    > meticulously until you become confident enough that defects which
    > remain are sufficiently rare. If a firm were to go though the
    > expense of producing highly secure software, how could they
    > credibly demonstrate to customers the absence of bugs? It's a
    > market for lemons.

- writing poetry: sum of creativity on reddit

    > produced by a single human being. but yet reddit can’t make it
    > coherent, it can’t polish it. but a poet can polish their work

- programming: "over-engineering" something; and of course Facebook's famous "move fast and break things; if you're not breaking things you're not moving fast enough" etc.^[Though Zuckerberg has shifted Facebook away from that now.]

- 80-20 rule
- semantic web; impatience
- same with semantic web: the market won’t accept it because people don’t wanna put in the work
- same with archiving things
