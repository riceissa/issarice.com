My donation history begins in 2015 because that is the year during which I first started working.

# 2015

I earned around $2,000 doing mostly content creation work under Vipul Naik.
I did not donate in 2015 because I am still [building a financial buffer](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-good-amount-of-financial-buffer-to-have-for-a-single-male/answer/Vipul-Naik).

# 2016

I earned around [$9700][cw] (not counting deferred payments) working under
Vipul Naik.
I did not donate in 2016 because I am still building a financial buffer.
