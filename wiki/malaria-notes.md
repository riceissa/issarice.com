# Summary

This page contains notes as I read about malaria.

Some questions I'd like to address:

* If swamp-draining and DDT were the methods used to eliminate malaria in the
  United States, why are LLINs what we hear about nowadays?
* Why was DDT banned?
  What were the tradeoffs involved in the banning?
* Regarding a 1953 WHO antimalarial program in Liberia, Wikipedia
  [says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_malaria#DDT) "these
  projects encountered difficulties that foreshadowed the general retreat from
  malaria eradication efforts across tropical Africa by the mid-1960s."
  What happened?
  What were these difficulties?

# Notes

Webb (2010):

> DDT worked most effectively when sprayed on impermeable walls where it could
> continue to kill insects landing there for more than 3 months. But more than
> 50 percent of the interior house walls in Monrovia were constructed of
> laterite bricks, a natural hard claylike soil that is high in iron and
> aluminum. The DDT soaked through these walls, instead of staying on the
> surface, and thus was much less effective as a residual insecticide. At the
> time, there was no entomologist or chemist in Liberia who understood the
> issue, and work proceeded on an ad hoc basis. When the DDT seemed no longer
> to do the job—that is, to kill the mosquitoes inside the dwelling—the
> sprayers returned and sprayed again. The result was roughly a once-a-month
> spraying cycle with exceedingly high per capita costs.

* DDT not used "because of concerns over its effectiveness in coastal Liberia".
* Fog generator attempted but "achieved limited success, owing to the
  difficulty of getting proper wind direction and movement and the need to
  release the fog before the sun's heat became intense after 9 a.m.
  A technology that had worked reasonably well in the United States did not
  transfer well to coastal Liberia."

[Webb (2014, p. 94)](https://books.google.com/books?id=eV72AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA84&ots=DN3m_nMzEg&dq=DLD%20malaria&pg=PA94#v=onepage&q=DLD%20malaria&f=false):

> For African adults, malaria was largely perceived as an annoyance, an
> unpleasant reality of life like the seasonal flu, rather than a vital problem
> to be tackled with scarce resources.
> At independence, most African states declined to take up the
> "pre-eradication" programs – in essence, malaria control programs that would
> be developed to build capacity – recommended by the WHO.

["The ban of DDT did not cause millions to die from malaria"](http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~mpalmer/stuff/DDT-myth.pdf)
by Michael Palmer:

> Malaria remains rampant because control efforts lack resources and political
> support, not because of the choice of insecticide. Where insect resistance to
> it is not yet widespread, DDT remains a legitimate weapon against malaria.
> However, DDT is not a panacea, and the limited restrictions imposed on its
> use are not a significant factor in the current deplorable state of affairs
> in malaria morbidity and mortality.

From [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4005199/):

> Knowledge of the role of mosquitoes in malaria transmission (11.8%) and cause
> of malaria (9.6%) was observed to be low among the study population.
> Comprehensive knowledge about malaria prevention measures was high (90%), but
> not reflecting in their practice (16%). They have good knowledge of mosquito
> behavior (breeding areas (64.5%), resting places (70%) and biting time
> (81%)). Seeking hospital care for a febrile child was a good practice (68.5%)
> observed. Attitudes regarding the best antimalarial therapy was limited
> (56.7%) to chloroquine.

The [CDC says](https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/biology/mosquitoes/):

> Most *Anopheles* mosquitoes are crepuscular (active at dusk or dawn) or
> nocturnal (active at night). Some *Anopheles* mosquitoes feed indoors
> (endophagic) while others feed outdoors (exophagic). After blood feeding,
> some *Anopheles* mosquitoes prefer to rest indoors (endophilic) while
> others prefer to rest outdoors (exophilic). Biting by nocturnal,
> endophagic *Anopheles* mosquitoes can be markedly reduced through the use
> of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) or through improved housing
> construction to prevent mosquito entry (e.g., window screens). Endophilic
> mosquitoes are readily controlled by indoor spraying of residual
> insecticides. In contrast, exophagic/exophilic vectors are best
> controlled through source reduction (destruction of the breeding sites).

[This paper](https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2875-10-183)
notes some sensitivities for mosquitoes to temperature.

# Malaria FAQs

* [CDC's malaria FAQ](https://www.cdc.gov/Malaria/about/faqs.html)
* [WHO South-East Regional Office's malaria
  FAQ](http://www.searo.who.int/entity/malaria/SEAR_FAQ_Malaria.pdf)

Do these FAQs adequately address the common questions?
They probably address most of them, but some questions (especially those that
might seem stupid) might be missing.
Examples:

* Don't mosquitoes need swamps to breed?
  And isn't Africa full of desert regions?
  What gives?
* Do non-mosquito vectors exist for malaria?
  If so why do we never hear about them?
* What's up with the push toward mosquito extinction?

*   Mosquitoes can't fly that far, right?
    Why can't we just create "safe zones" by draining all the swamps around
    cities?
    A better-formulated version of this is given in Dowling and Yap,
    *Communicable diseases in Developing Countries* (p 132):

    > On the surface, malaria looks like an easier target to control and eradicate
    > than HIV-, TB- or cholera-type diseases. This is because malaria is borne by
    > mosquitoes and should be easier to track and control than humans whose
    > behavior is hard to predict and control and who are not subject to
    > eradication using chemicals.

* So I heard the Romans used sheep to attract mosquitoes away from humans.
  Why don't we do that now?
  Can't we just make some artificial warm-bodied *thing*?
* The CDC FAQ says "the eradication campaign never involved most of Africa,
  where malaria is the most common".
  Why was this the case?
* What does the pie chart of spending within malaria look like?
* What does the pie chart of spending on malaria, seen in terms of all of
  global health, look like?
* Why are there [no malaria vectors in parts of northern
  Africa](https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/biology/mosquitoes/map.html)?
  It's coastal so there can be mosquitoes, right?
