# Summary

This page contains notes as I read about malaria.

Some questions I'd like to address:

* If swamp-draining and DDT were the methods used to eradicate malaria in the
  United States, why are LLINs what we hear about nowadays?
* Why was DDT banned?
  What were the tradeoffs involved in the banning?
* Regarding a 1953 WHO antimalarial program in Liberia, Wikipedia
  [says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_malaria#DDT) "these
  projects encountered difficulties that foreshadowed the general retreat from
  malaria eradication efforts across tropical Africa by the mid-1960s."
  What happened?
  What were these difficulties?

# Notes

Webb (2010):

> DDT worked most effectively when sprayed on impermeable walls where it could
> continue to kill insects landing there for more than 3 months. But more than
> 50 percent of the interior house walls in Monrovia were constructed of
> laterite bricks, a natural hard claylike soil that is high in iron and
> aluminum. The DDT soaked through these walls, instead of staying on the
> surface, and thus was much less effective as a residual insecticide. At the
> time, there was no entomologist or chemist in Liberia who understood the
> issue, and work proceeded on an ad hoc basis. When the DDT seemed no longer
> to do the job—that is, to kill the mosquitoes inside the dwelling—the
> sprayers returned and sprayed again. The result was roughly a once-a-month
> spraying cycle with exceedingly high per capita costs.
