I am taking the idea of status tags from gwern.
Here is his original explanation, though my use (explained below) differs slightly.

> The "status" tag describes the state of completion: whether it's a pile of links & snippets & "notes", or whether it is a "draft" which at least has some structure and conveys a coherent thesis, or it's a well-developed draft which could be described as "in progress", and finally when a page is done - in lieu of additional material turning up - it is simply "finished".

Below is how I use status tags:

Notes
:    Same as gwern, i.e. for pages that are just collections of links and quotes.
I also use this for brief posts in general; one can treat them like Facebook status updates---except, they might eventually build up to something more.

Draft
:    Same as gwern, i.e. for pages that have a rough direction but aren't solid.

In progress
:    Same as gwern, i.e. for pages that fairly solid but aren't very polished or meticulous.

Mostly finished
:    For pages that I consider mostly done, needing only minor corrections.
