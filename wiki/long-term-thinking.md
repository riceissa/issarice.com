I'm a big fan of **long-term thinking**; after all, I'm very interested in anti-aging, [long content](), [durable link]()s, and so on.
I think Peter Thiel nailed it with these quotes:

> People always say they want to live every day as though it will be their
> last. I always have this contrasting view that I think I’d like to live
> every day as though it will go on for ever.
>
> If we had an indefinite life span, we would continue to work and start
> great new projects, we would be very careful about how we treated the
> people around us because we would encounter them again.[^forever]

[^forever]: “[Peter Thiel: ‘We attribute too much to luck. Luck is an atheistic word for God’](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/21/peter-thiel-paypal-luck-atheist-god)\ ”.

> People always say you should live your life as if it were your last day.
> I think you should live your life as though it will go on for ever; that
> every day is so good that you don’t want it to end.[^telegraph]
