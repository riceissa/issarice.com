I'm not sure it's the case that there are a
lot of people with Asperger syndrome in effective altruism (EA); this
would be the case in any movement of sufficient size. I think the burden
of proof is on the person asking the question to provide evidence for
what they are seeing. Having interacted with the EA community for over a
year, I don't get this impression, though I haven't actually gone out
and surveyed how many people with Asperger syndrome are associated with
EA. I would also note that "Asperger syndrome" gets slapped onto
movements on occasion without evidence. Libertarianism and in particular
the open borders movement has had this happen; see [Asperger’s syndrome at Open Borders: The
Case](http://openborders.info/aspergers-syndrome/) for more. As
Evan at Open Borders: The Case writes (in [Autism Can’t Explain Away Open Borders
Arguments](http://openborders.info/blog/autism-cant-explain-away-open-borders-arguments/)),
"the project of associating political positions \[or social movements!\]
with mental disorders is probably not a wise undertaking in the first
place".

To the extent that people with Asperger syndrome seem over-represented
in EA, I offer several reasons. Note that I have a low level of
confidence in these explanations, which are more akin to
rationalizations (which might still be useful to verbalize). One is that
people involved with the tech industry are over-represented in EA (see
[What happened to all the
non-programmers?](http://www.benkuhn.net/nonprog)), and if we
grant that people involved in tech are more likely to have Asperger
syndrome (see for instance [Peter Thiel on
the Future of Innovation — Conversations with
Tyler](https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/peter-thiel-on-the-future-of-innovation-77628a43c0dd)),
then it might seem like many people with Asperger syndrome are also in
EA.

Another related idea is that both people with Asperger syndrome and
those in effective altruism compartmentalize less relative to the
general population. Effective altruism is well-known for preferring
quantitative measures of effectiveness as well as explicit verbal
reasoning of actions (so they might be more likely to change their
beliefs when faced with new evidence). This is also a stereotype of
people with Asperger syndrome (who are thought to be bad at nonverbal
communication, are thought to be savants who are good at quantitative
subjects, and so on).
