title: Account names

Below I list the account names I use on various websites.
As with [software](software), I like to sign up for a lot of online services to
try them out, even though I know I won't continue using most of them.

I usually use "riceissa" on most sites.
This is a historical accident: when I tried to sign up for my Gmail
account, "issarice" was already taken, so I picked "riceissa" instead.
Since then, I've sort of standardized on "riceissa" for most services, although
I also use "issarice".

# Social

- My Google account name is riceissa.
  In particular, my Gmail address is [riceissa@gmail.com][email].
- My [Facebook]() account name is [riceissa][fbp]. I check Facebook regularly
  throughout the day. I generally accept all friend requests that don’t
  appear to be spam; having some mutual friends or messaging me
  simultaneously with your friend request will let me know that your
  profile is genuine.
- I check [Quora]() on occasion. My Quora account name is
  [Issa-Rice][qp].
- I have a [Pinboard account](https://pinboard.in/u:riceissa).
  I tested out Pinboard for a year and didn't renew my payment afterward so it
  is now frozen.
- I have a [LinkedIn profile][lp]. I
  don’t use LinkedIn much, but feel free to connect with me.
- I am [riceissa][tp] on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/). I don’t use
  Twitter much, and when I do it’s mostly to read what others have
  tweeted.
- I am [riceissa](https://www.pinterest.com/riceissa/) on Pinterest.
  I created the account after making additions to the [Timeline of Pinterest](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timeline_of_Pinterest&action=history&year=2017&month=2&tagfilter=)
  page on Wikipedia -- I got curious about the site and decided to play around.

# Websites I run or someone I know runs

- I am [Issa](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/User:Issa) on the [Timelines
  Wiki](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Main_Page), which I run.
- I am both issa and Issa Rice on [Cause Prioritization
  Wiki](https://causeprioritization.org/), which I run.
  I originally used "issa" as my account, but gitit, the software that runs the
  wiki, uses the committer name (in my case, "Issa Rice", as I have
  [Git](git) configured to use my real name) as the account name for
  offline edits.
  Seeing this, I decided to start using "Issa Rice" for online edits as well.
- I am [Riceissa](https://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/User:Riceissa) on the
  Cognito Mentoring wiki, which is created by Vipul Naik and Jonah Sinick.
- I am [IssaRice](https://machinelearning.subwiki.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/IssaRice)
  on the Machine Learning wiki, created by Vipul Naik.
- I am [IssaRice](https://demography.subwiki.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/IssaRice)
  on the Demography Subwiki, created by Vipul Naik.
- I am [IssaRice](https://calculus.subwiki.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/IssaRice)
  on the Calculus Subwiki, created by Vipul Naik.
  Apparently I never made any edits on this wiki.

- I am [riceissa](https://www.reddit.com/user/riceissa/) on [Reddit](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Using_reddit).
  I occasionally use Reddit to look for information, but don’t really post.

  on the Archiveteam wiki.
- [My Internet Archive account](https://archive.org/details/@issarice)
- [My Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47708980-issa-rice).
  I rarely finish books. Usually what I do is to look at the parts that
  interest me or that are relevant to something I am working on. This could
  mean I read most of the book or just a few chapters or even just a small
  section. At least by default Goodreads has only "read", "currently reading",
  and "want to read" as options, and I'm not sure which of the first two I
  should select given my reading style.
- [My MyAnimeList account](http://myanimelist.net/profile/riceissa)
- I am [Issa-Rice](https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/Issa-Rice) on
  Couchsurfing.
  I made the account but I have never used the site for couchsurfing.
- I am [riceissa](https://disqus.com/by/riceissa/) on Disqus.
  I made a couple of scattered comments using the service but haven't used it
  in years.
