Below I list the account names I use on various websites.

I usually use "riceissa" on most sites.
This is somewhat of a historical accident: when I tried to sign up for my GMail
account, "issarice" was already taken, so I picked "riceissa" instead.
Since then, I've sort of standardized on "riceissa" for most services, although
I also use "issarice".

# Social

- My [Facebook]() account name is [riceissa][fbp].  I check Facebook regularly
  throughout the day.  I generally accept all friend requests that don’t
  appear to be spam; having some mutual friends or messaging me
  simultaneously with your friend request will let me know that your
  profile is genuine.
- I check [Quora]() on occasion.  My Quora account name is
  [Issa-Rice][qp].
- I have a [Pinboard account](https://pinboard.in/u:riceissa).
  I tested out Pinboard for a year and didn't renew my payment afterward so it
  is now frozen.
- I have a [LinkedIn profile][lp].  I
  don’t use LinkedIn very much, but feel free to connect with me.
- I am [riceissa][tp] on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/).  I don’t use
  Twitter very often, and when I do it’s mostly to read what others have
  tweeted.
