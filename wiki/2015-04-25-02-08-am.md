I feel like lately I've changed some beliefs a lot, especially from
reading Caplan and Beckstead.  And I think I should try to write this
change up too, though I'm not exactly sure how to do that.  Writing
takes a long time, especially if I want to post it to places like the EA
Forum or the CP wiki (which isn't really a place for person opinions
anyway, but I could still synthesize what I learned and outline it
there).

I feel like I've underestimated the usefulness of blogs in the name of
making everything "timeless".  Clearly it's important to have canonical
references for things, but at the same time, I should realize that
sometimes, it takes a long time to get to the canonical form, and that
in the meantime, *it's okay* to write things chronologically, and have
snapshots of my thought.  Of course, git makes it possible to have
snapshots of thoughts regardless, but ordering things by time *can* be
useful.
