For what I mean by "intuitive nutrition", see [this fairly introductory post](https://meditationstuff.wordpress.com/2020/05/10/intuition-based-nutrition/). On this page, I try to collect case studies of people eating in this way and the ways in which it's helped (or harmed!) them.

- Elizabeth Van Nostrand's [thread](https://twitter.com/acesounderglass/status/1504591434707468316) about [[MealSquares]] and V8
- Qiaochu Yuan on electrolytes, see [here](https://twitter.com/QiaochuYuan/status/1506108907470483458) for instance but he's talk about this in a bunch of places.
- I used to get a lot of cravings for sweets (especially chocolate) in the evenings. At the time, I attributed this to some combination of "lol I guess I am addicted to sugar huh" and "I guess I have low willpower at night or something??". Then when I started eating 1-2 tbsp butter every day (not specifically to stop the cravings -- it was recommended to me because it seemed like I wasn't getting enough saturated fat), I noticed that the cravings stopped. Now whenever I don't eat butter for a few days the cravings return (for some reason, the cravings are still *specifically* for chocolate), but otherwise I basically don't crave sweets anymore (aside from very rare occasions, like once every two months or so, for reasons I haven't yet figured out). I still keep chocolate on the dresser in my room for whenever I feel like eating it, and it just doesn't feel like it takes any willpower at all to prevent myself from eating it.
