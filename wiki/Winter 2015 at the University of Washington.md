# Courses

- [[CSE 143]]
- [[CSE 390 (for CSE 143)]]

# Review

In many ways, winter quarter was just a continuation of autumn quarter (this is reflected partially in the classes I took---for math and computer science I just took the next course in the respective sequences).
I think I was able to take this quarter a little less seriously in terms of trying to get the highest possible grade (though perhaps this did hurt me a bit in CS).
