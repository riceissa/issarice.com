# Summary

This page intends to describe the style of social science research that Vipul
Naik advocates, in the most matter of fact way possible -- I don't intend to
describe my own thoughts of it because they are complicated and still not
well-formed.

The general thrust of the approach, as I understand it, is as follows:

  * For inputs to research, emphasize conducting online surveys and writing
    quick Facebook posts to gather thoughts.
    De-emphasize academic papers.
  * During the research, do things in places that are publicly visible and
    where the record of changes is accessible (e.g. Git repository and
    Wikipedia).
  * For outputs from the research, separate them into tiers in terms of
    importance: quick notes or graphs that can fit into pre-existing work,
    medium-size articles that can build up general knowledge, and major
    articles that comprehensively argue some point.
  * For venue of outputs, emphasize likely pageviews and how the contribution
    topically fits in.
    De-emphasize comfort and the building of a personal brand.

# Background

As of December 2016, I have been working with Vipul regularly since April 2016.

# Caveats:

Some caveats to note about this page:

  * This page has not been reviewed by Vipul, so I might be mischaracterizing
    parts of his approach.
  * According to the approach, I have not yet gone through all of the steps.
    In other words, I am still midway in following all of the steps outlined
    here.

# Projects that use or have used this approach

To my knowledge and recollection, two projects use this approach:

  * Some parts of [*Open Borders: The Case*](http://openborders.info)
  * My own dive into global health
