# Summary

This page intends to describe the style of social science research that Vipul
Naik advocates, in the most matter of fact way possible -- I don't intend to
describe my own thoughts of it because they are complicated and still not
well-formed.
I try to convey both the theory/intuition for why the approach might make sense
as well as what actually happens in practice (if it differs from the theory).

The general thrust of the approach, as I understand it, is as follows:

  * For inputs to research, emphasize conducting online surveys and writing
    quick Facebook posts to gather thoughts.
    De-emphasize academic papers.
  * During the research, do things in places that are publicly visible and
    where the record of changes is accessible (e.g. Git repository and
    Wikipedia).
  * For outputs of the research, separate them into tiers in terms of
    importance: quick notes or graphs that can fit into pre-existing work,
    medium-size articles that can build up general knowledge, and major
    articles that comprehensively argue some point.
    The small- and medium-size outputs are called a "paper trail" or "digital
    trail".
  * When choosing the venue of outputs, emphasize the expected number of
    pageviews and how the contribution topically fits in.
    De-emphasize comfort and the building of a personal brand.

# Background

As of December 2016, I have been working with Vipul regularly since April 2016.

# Caveats

Some caveats to note about this page:

  * This page has not been reviewed by Vipul, so I might be mischaracterizing
    parts of his approach.
  * According to the approach, I have not yet gone through all of the steps.
    In other words, I am still midway in following all of the steps outlined
    here.

# Output levels

See Vipul's ["Debugging My Apparent 2016 Stagnation" § Significant shift to
producing longer and much more thoroughly researched content](http://vipulnaik.com/blog/debugging-my-apparent-2016-stagnation/).

# The paper trail

Although this is not a requirement, in general the "paper trail" part of the
research comes in several standard forms:

  * Wikipedia articles about parts of the topic
  * Wikipedia timelines of some aspect of the history of the topic

There seems to be a psychological aspect to the paper trail beyond providing
value to others: it's motivating to see that one's writing is getting
pageviews, that there is *some* progress being made on difficult questions,
that one's time has not been a complete waste, and so forth.

The paper trail can have other benefits that are not as important:

  * It's a way to put things out in public so others can critique your
    thinking.
  * It provides a sort of detailed outline of your thinking.

# Projects that use or have used this approach

To my knowledge and recollection, two projects use this approach:

  * Some parts of [*Open Borders: The Case*](http://openborders.info)
  * My own dive into global health

# Changes in major output

In April 2017, Vipul published ["Why I stopped quarterly reviews, and what
replaces them"][stop_quarterly] on his blog.
In the post he describes how his thinking on the "major articles" part of the
research process has changed:

> My goal with both these kinds of posts is to, essentially, write them *only*
> once the ideas are all in my head and reasonably clear, so that it's just a
> straight exercise of transcribing from my head to the computer. Given that I
> have no particular pressure to "publish", I believe it does not make much
> sense to artificially try to put in custom, "hacky" effort to push out posts
> of either of the above kinds in a way that interrupts the flow of the larger
> projects I am working on.
>
> To give an idea of what I used to do, and am now choosing against: there is
> this strategy where I would decide to work hard on pushing out a wrapper post
> about a topic I've been learning about, even if I didn't feel like I was
> fully ready to write it, or knew all the relevant facts. Examples of the
> kinds of topics I am talking about: understanding trends in Wikipedia
> pageviews, or understanding the history of immigration enforcement in the
> United States since 1986. My past strategy was: I would just draft it, pull
> in a fact from here and a fact from here, revisit, redraft, rewrite, and soon
> get something that looked okay. And there was a time, early on, when I found
> that this kind of effort helped me focus and collate information that I would
> not otherwise have interest in systematically grasping. And I still respect
> this approach.
>
> However, my current belief is that in this sort of situation, it's better to
> just keep collating background information in accessible formats. such as
> continued work on the Wikipedia Views website, to make it easier and easier
> to look up Wikipedia view trends, or work on timeline of immigration
> enforcement in the United States. And then to start working on the wrapper
> post only when I feel I have enough to say that I can just sit down and say
> it.

# Ways in which this approach differs from other approaches

  * Unlike writing several papers or writing several blog posts on one's blog,
    this approach has more variety in publication venue.
