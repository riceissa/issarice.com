# Summary

This page intends to describe the style of social science research that Vipul
Naik advocates, in the most matter of fact way possible -- I don't intend to
describe my own thoughts of it because they are complicated and still not
well-formed.

The general thrust of the approach, as I understand it, is as follows:

  * 

# Existing writings on this and related subjects

  * ["My three guiding principles"](http://vipulnaik.com/blog/my-three-guiding-principles/)
    by Vipul
  * ["Sponsored Wikipedia editing"](http://vipulnaik.com/sponsored-wikipedia-editing/)
    by Vipul
  * [Vipul's contract work repository on GitHub](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork),
    which includes a comprehensive list of things he has paid to create

# Background

As of December 2016, I have been working with Vipul regularly since April 2016.

# Caveats:

Some caveats to note about this page:

  * This page has not been reviewed by Vipul, so I might be mischaracterizing
    parts of his approach.

# Projects that use or have used this approach

To my knowledge and recollection, two projects use this approach:

  * Some parts of [*Open Borders: The Case*](http://openborders.info)
  * My own dive into global health
