This page lists the Japanese translation of AI safety terms, as given
in the Japanese translation of Nick Bostrom's _Superintelligence_.
Page numbers in the notes column are all from the hardcover edition of
the Japanese translation.

My main hope for this page is that in a few years it will be easier to
find online discussions of AI safety in Japanese (if such things
exist), by Googling some of the terms on this page. The book title may
be sufficient, but it's likely to miss discussions that just "dive in"
without mentioning the book, and also the book title alone may turn up
a lot of useless results (like those trying to sell the book).
