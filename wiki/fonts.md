This page lists some fonts I like.

- I like [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) (although one problem with this font is that it has too much vertical height so less text fits on the screen when programming), Ubuntu Mono, DejaVu Sans Mono, and Consolas for monospace. For the last few years (since 2021) I've just been using Consolas.
- For serif, I like Bitstream Charter, Source Serif Pro, Palatino, and Stone Serif.
- For sans serif, I like [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/). (I'm actually rather curious about the rise in popularity of Lato, which is why I asked [How did the Lato font become so popular?](https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Lato-font-become-so-popular))
