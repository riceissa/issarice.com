This page lists some fonts I like.

- I like [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro),
  Ubuntu Mono, DejaVu Sans Mono, and
  Consolas for monospace.
- For serif, I like Bitstream Charter and Palatino.
I also like thicker variants of Computer Modern (if on screen; the thinner ones are fine on paper).
- For sans serif, I like [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/).
(I'm actually rather curious about the rise in popularity of Lato, which is why I asked [How did the Lato font become so popular?](https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Lato-font-become-so-popular))
