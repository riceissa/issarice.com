For a project, I recently looked at GiveWell's staff growth over the years.
The data is from the [Our People](http://givewell.org/about/people) page, retrieved using the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/).
The page seems to have been created in mid-2010, so that's where the table starts (and before that, the number was presumably 2--4 anyway).
This is meant to be illustrative and not comprehensive.
Care was taken to detect the first point in time when an employee appeared or disappeared from a page, so the above table should be generally accurate but probably not completely so.
The Wayback Machine also had spotty coverage that lacked several months.
