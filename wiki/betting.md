*Just some notes for now.
My thoughts on this topic haven't been stress-tested.*

One of the things that confuses me about EA/rationalist betting is that there
is no central authority generating questions on which to bet, so that each
person is betting on whatever they want to.
The same is true of Prediction Book as far as I know (I've never used the
site).
To game one's calibration, one need only predict appropriately on some obvious
things to "nudge" the calibration back to a good value.
To take an example, suppose for events one has predicted to occur with a 50%
chance, the actual percentage of them occurring so far has been 90% (i.e. one
is underconfident).
Then, to bring the latter percentage down (to be "well-calibrated"), one need
only look for some events that are unlikely to happen (i.e. much less than a
50% chance of occurring), but then state that one predicts they will happen
with 50% chance.

Other thoughts:

  * At least in some cases, betting in the EA/rationalist community seems to
    create a "winner/loser" mentality, where people are hyperfocused on the
    results on a *particular* bet (example: people posting how much they won or
    lost after the 2016 US presidential election).
    If betting is truly about rationality, it's the *cumulative* bets and
    overall track-record that matter.
    I think the case is similar to the one to [avoid the news][news].
  * I think it's interesting that many rationalists are against news, but end
    up betting on news-worthy topics (but are these just the ones more likely
    to show up in my Facebook feed?).
  * I think even worse than self-selecting which bets to take is to announce
    some bet one is willing to make in an effort to lure people into taking on
    bets.
  * I have some concern that people are to some extent offering and taking on
    bets because it looks "cool" and "everyone else is doing it".
  * Similarly to the point above, there are various motivations that lead
    people to bet.
  * Once a bet has been made, there are various new incentives to affect the
    outcome of the bet.
    I don't think these are acknowledged very often, although as long as people
    are betting on relatively "large" events that are difficult to affect, this
    point is minor.
  * Claims that betting "taxes bullshit" or "fights hyperbole" rely on the
    penalty of losing to be greater than the benefit of making those hyperbolic
    claims in the first place.
    And, again, one cannot just look at the outcome of a *single bet* and claim
    that "I fought hyperbole and won".
  * Until betting frequently becomes the norm, betting does not seem especially
    lucrative.
    It requires people who are willing to take you on the bet, to give you odds
    that are favorable enough, the cost of being informed about the thing you
    are betting on, the cost of due diligence to ensure your opponent will pay
    up, etc.
  * A possible scenario I want to think more about: a world where there is a
    constant stream of low-stakes bets (from some authority) on which one is
    required to take a position.
    The authority then matches you with someone taking the opposite position.
    Or perhaps people submit their subjective probabilities and the authority
    matches people up with suitable odds (as long as subjective probabilities
    differ, the authority can devise odds that are profitable to both sides
    each given their own expectation?).

Not all of the above points are unique to betting.

I plan to write more about why I like betting later.
