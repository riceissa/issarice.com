This page considers **individual transparency** (which is distinct from organizational transparency) both online and offline.
Individual transparency can lead to things like having stalkers (that one can befriend) and [being harassed](harassment).
It can also inspire people, give you a tight feedback loop, or lead to [serendipitous discoveries](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-secret-to-finding-the-right-peers/answer/Alex-K-Chen).

In many ways, I try to take an "open by default" approach by e.g. making many
of my [activity feeds publicly
available](https://issarice.com/#activity-feeds).

# Advantages

- Transparency is also a meta statement that roughly says "yes, you can share this stuff with other people"; this can be good for getting feedback from a wide array of people (e.g. if you ask someone for feedback, they can forward it to others *without having to ask you for permission*, since everything is public anyway).
- Transparency can be a way to combat gossip about oneself (see [one of the comments

- Transparency is [one of the results of humility][holden_humility].
