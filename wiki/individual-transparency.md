This page considers **individual transparency** (which is distinct from organizational transparency) both online and offline.
Individual transparency can lead to things like having [stalkers](stalking) (that one can befriend) and [being harassed](harassment).
It can also inspire people, give you a tight feedback loop, or lead to [serendipitous discoveries](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-secret-to-finding-the-right-peers/answer/Alex-K-Chen).

- [What are the advantages and disadvantages of making information about oneself available online through for example smart phone apps and social media posts?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-making-information-about-oneself-available-online-through-for-example-smart-phone-apps-and-social-media-posts)---question inspired by Sebastian Nickel's Facebook discussion (linked from the question).

# Advantages

- Transparency is also a meta statement that roughly says "yes, you can share this stuff with other people"; this can be good for getting feedback from a wide array of people (e.g. if you ask someone for feedback, they can forward it to others *without having to ask you for permission*, since everything is public anyway).
