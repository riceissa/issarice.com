This page contains information about my UW CSE application.
I applied after one full year at the University of Washington, for the July 2015 deadline.
I was admitted to the major (on my first attempt) on July 24.

The main purpose of this page is to be transparent about my academic situation, and also so that people interested in applying to CSE have one more data point they can use.
Before I was admitted, I would often stress out over whether I was good enough to be admitted, and so on.
Moreover, when people posted their grades online, they would often only list their overall GPA (not very useful, since prerequisite classes matter much more), their prerequisite GPA (more useful, but still doesn't provide a full picture), or even just their CSE 142/3 grades (and my CSE 143 grade wasn't as high as I had hoped it would be, so I was quite worried hearing almost everyone had gotten a 3.9 or 4.0 in that course)!
In light of this, I'd like to provide my "full stats" so people have more information.
