In late April 2017 Vipul Naik sponsored my creation of the
[timeline of Against Malaria Foundation](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Against_Malaria_Foundation).
I spent around 33 hours working on the timeline in all.
In the process I had various thoughts about the organization that
didn't suit the timeline format.
This page gathers some of these thoughts.

Some of these thoughts may come across in a "devil's advocate" kind of way.

One thing I found odd was how little information there is about the two
main people running the organization, Rob Mather and Andrew Garner.
I think I read just about every biographical blurb about Rob Mather that's
available on the internet, and I still have no idea who he is.
He was supposedly a successful businessman, but what was the company
he worked for?
Who were his clients?
If you look at the [old trustees page](https://web.archive.org/web/20080310014341/http://www.worldswimagainstmalaria.com:80/aboutus_trustees.aspx#RM),
you might notice that for many of the biographies,
peope list where they've worked ("Brand Director for Sainsbury's
supermarkets and prior to that Marketing Director for Coca-Cola
across Central Europe and for L'Oreal in the UK", "Lehman",
"Executive Director of Capital & Regional Plc, a UK listed property
company", etc.), but this is not the case for Rob Mather.
We are talking about a guy running a charity that has raised
over $100 million who has appeared out of nowhere in 2003.

I think Andrew Garner is similarly a mystery.
Yes, you can find his [barely-active Twitter account](https://twitter.com/ajgarner)
and some [old publications in physics](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/positron-physics/uclrefyr.html),
but aside from that, there isn't a lot that I could find.
