I just modified my `newpage.sh` script that I use to set up new pages on
my website so that there is now a default title for entries
(pages)---namely just the date and time of creation.  I hope this will
help me write more on here, because one problem I've had is that I have
trouble coming up with good titles for pages.  In the name of "long
content" and "long-term thinking", I've tried to use canonical names for
page titles rather than sensationalist clickbait titles, but this has
had the side-effect of me deliberating for too long to think of the
*perfect title*, when sometimes none exists.  I feel like often it's
better to simply write with no title---or even the sensationalist one,
which admittedly also requires thinking---and then come back later and
fix things up.  I did write the `aliases: ` feature for my static site
generator *preciesely for this reason*; namely so that later if I change
my mind about the page title, I can come back and add aliases so that
everything eventually leads to the same place.
