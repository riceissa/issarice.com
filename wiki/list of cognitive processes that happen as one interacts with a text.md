(Motivation: when people read things, they're not just linearly processing the words and then storing each word in their head. They might be jumping around in the text to find the "interesting" parts or might be searching for something specific. This makes typography tricky: you can't just say "this is a book. so we use the typography of a book"; as the reader's mental activity changes, the "best" typography also changes. And that's just for a single reader! If we consider all the possible readers who might get value from a text, that's a lot of different purposes and mental activities going on. So. The goal here is to list out a bunch of mental activities and then see how design/typography decisions can improve the experience of each activity.)

Things you do when "reading" something. Or: distinct cognitive processes that happen as you interact with a text.

For each thing below, I want to figure out how it maps onto design decisions. How can a better designed page cater to each activity/process? Some of it will be best-addressed at the "explanation level" or "writing style level" rather than the typography/design level, but I'm still interested in seeing if there are easy design tweaks that can be made to improve reading experience.

- reading the words in order, trying to transfer ink to your mental scratchpad/verbal word-recognizer/sentence-parser
- scanning around to see if anything catches your eye
- scanning to find a particular thing you have in mind. This may require using an index or search bar.
- trying to find a thing that you know is somewhere here but you can't remember what exactly it's called or what page it was on
- verbalizing a particular question in your head, hoping the text will answer it.
- verbalizing a particular reaction/opinion to the text, hoping the author could respond to your point.
- something clicks. you highlight/underline, maybe.
- scanning because you just want the *point*. You're skeptical you have to read *so many words* to understand the point. You wish the point could just be given to you, somehow.
- You feel vaguely bored, bounce off, you think "tl;dr".
- You're excited. You've been waiting a long time for this piece to come out, or it's by your favorite writer. You want to absorb every word, every insight.
- You just *finished* "reading". You wish there was something more. You feel fooled. You feel the text did not deliver on what it implicitly or explicitly promised.
- You're not sure you're absorbing the text. You wish someone could test you on the knowledge. You wish you could practice, apply, the knowledge, so that you know you're not just overfitting on the particular example given in the text.
- You wish for a goddamned example.
- The idea is interesting, but it's just not written in a style you like engaging with. Maybe it's too illegible/murky, maybe it's not [technical](https://www.readthesequences.com/A-Technical-Explanation-Of-Technical-Explanation) enough.
- You see clarification on the meaning of a particular word, or the relevance of the statement just made, more elaboration of something. You want to "click through" on something. You wish it were a hyperlink.
