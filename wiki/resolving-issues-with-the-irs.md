This page details my experiences with the IRS as I filed my first tax return.[^tax_2015]

On my original Form 1040, I accidentally entered my failure-to-file and failure-to-pay penalties on line 79.
As I explained [in a Personal Finance & Money Stack Exchange question](http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/66793/how-should-form-1040-be-amended-if-error-was-introduced-on-lines-78-and-79/66829#66829):

> Previously I asked ["Where is payment for failure-to-file and failure-to-pay penalties included on Form 1040?"](http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/66741/where-is-payment-for-failure-to-file-and-failure-to-pay-penalties-included-on-fo) There I found out that the failure-to-file and failure-to-pay penalties should not be included on line 79.
>
> I made the mistake of placing my failure-to-file and failure-to-pay penalties on line 79, so that the IRS decided to calculate penalties on the amount that already included the penalties. In other words, call my total tax owed _X_ (i.e. what _should_ have been on line 78) and the penalty for this _Y_ (what should have been on the bottom margin). Then I already paid _X_ + _Y_ to the IRS, but the IRS calculated penalties on the amount _X_ + _Y_ rather than on just _X_, so it is requesting more money. In other words, once the error is resolved, the amount I _should_ pay already matches the amount I _did_ pay (so no net exchange of money is required).

You will notice that I asked a question about the penalty location before I asked about amending the return.
I also asked on Quora ["If I incorrectly included my failure-to-file penalty on line 79 of Form 1040, how should I amend this?"](https://www.quora.com/If-I-incorrectly-included-my-failure-to-file-penalty-on-line-79-of-Form-1040-how-should-I-amend-this)

Vipul Naik [answered my question](http://money.stackexchange.com/a/66829/44690) and figured that I should file Form 843.
As I explain in the comments to his answer, I called the IRS, who I had trouble reaching: my specific case after entering in the sequence of numbers was an automated response, and they hung up; I actually called the IRS about four or five times, but because the system for receiving the number sequence was so unforgiving (they wouldn't accept a number if I entered it too early, and sometimes even when I pressed a 9 to repeat the instructions, I didn't do so soon enough to prevent them from hanging up on me), they hung up on me each time.
I then called [the TAS](https://www.irs.gov/advocate/local-taxpayer-advocate) toll free number.
After being forwarded once, I spoke to someone (who consulted a supervisor).
He told me my situation was "unique", and eventually told me to fill in Form 843 and that I should attach a letter explaining my situation.
He said he didn't know what the expected response would look like, said the response would probably take 4--6 weeks, and that I should follow up by calling the IRS if I don't receive a response by then.

[^tax_2015]: Tax year 2015 was the first year for which I filed a return, because I had made money doing content creation work under Vipul Naik.
