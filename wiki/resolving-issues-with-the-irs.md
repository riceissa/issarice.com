This page details my experiences with the IRS as I filed my first tax return.[^tax_2015]

On my original Form 1040, I accidentally entered my failure-to-file and failure-to-pay penalties on line 79.
As I explained [in a Personal Finance & Money Stack Exchange question](http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/66793/how-should-form-1040-be-amended-if-error-was-introduced-on-lines-78-and-79/66829#66829):

> Previously I asked ["Where is payment for failure-to-file and failure-to-pay penalties included on Form 1040?"](http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/66741/where-is-payment-for-failure-to-file-and-failure-to-pay-penalties-included-on-fo) There I found out that the failure-to-file and failure-to-pay penalties should not be included on line 79.

> I made the mistake of placing my failure-to-file and failure-to-pay penalties on line 79, so that the IRS decided to calculate penalties on the amount that already included the penalties. In other words, call my total tax owed _X_ (i.e. what _should_ have been on line 78) and the penalty for this _Y_ (what should have been on the bottom margin). Then I already paid _X_ + _Y_ to the IRS, but the IRS calculated penalties on the amount _X_ + _Y_ rather than on just _X_, so it is requesting more money. In other words, once the error is resolved, the amount I _should_ pay already matches the amount I _did_ pay (so no net exchange of money is required).

[^tax_2015]: Tax year 2015 was the first year for which I filed a return, because I had made money doing content creation work under Vipul Naik.
