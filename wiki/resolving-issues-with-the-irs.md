title: Resolving issues with the IRS

This page details my experiences with the IRS as I filed my first tax return.[^tax_2015]
This is intended as a record of what happened, but also an anecdote or guide of sorts on how to resolve issues when dealing with bureaucratic systems.

On my original Form 1040, I accidentally entered my failure-to-file and failure-to-pay penalties on line 79.
As I explained [in a Personal Finance & Money Stack Exchange question](http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/66793/how-should-form-1040-be-amended-if-error-was-introduced-on-lines-78-and-79/66829#66829):

> Previously I asked ["Where is payment for failure-to-file and failure-to-pay penalties included on Form 1040?"](http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/66741/where-is-payment-for-failure-to-file-and-failure-to-pay-penalties-included-on-fo) There I found out that the failure-to-file and failure-to-pay penalties should not be included on line 79.

> I made the mistake of placing my failure-to-file and failure-to-pay penalties on line 79, so that the IRS decided to calculate penalties on the amount that already included the penalties. In other words, call my total tax owed _X_ (i.e. what _should_ have been on line 78) and the penalty for this _Y_ (what should have been on the bottom margin). Then I already paid _X_ + _Y_ to the IRS, but the IRS calculated penalties on the amount _X_ + _Y_ rather than on just _X_, so it is requesting more money. In other words, once the error is resolved, the amount I _should_ pay already matches the amount I _did_ pay (so no net exchange of money is required).

Specifically, I received a CP14 notice from the IRS.

You will notice that I asked a question about the penalty location before I asked about amending the return.
I also asked on Quora ["If I incorrectly included my failure-to-file penalty on line 79 of Form 1040, how should I amend this?"](https://www.quora.com/If-I-incorrectly-included-my-failure-to-file-penalty-on-line-79-of-Form-1040-how-should-I-amend-this)

Vipul Naik [answered my question](http://money.stackexchange.com/a/66829/44690) and figured that I should file Form 843.
As I explain in the comments to his answer, I called the IRS, who I had trouble reaching: my specific case after entering in the sequence of numbers was an automated response, and they hung up; I actually called the IRS about four or five times, but because the system for receiving the number sequence was so unforgiving (they wouldn't accept a number if I entered it too early, and sometimes even when I pressed a 9 to repeat the instructions, I didn't do so soon enough to prevent them from hanging up on me), they hung up on me each time.

I then called the [TAS toll free number](https://www.irs.gov/advocate/local-taxpayer-advocate).
After being forwarded once (by a person who said I should file Form 1040X, and when I explained further just gave up and forwarded me), I spoke to someone (who consulted a supervisor).
He told me my situation was "unique", and eventually told me to fill in Form 843 and that I should attach a letter explaining my situation.
He said he didn't know what the expected response would look like, said the response would probably take 4--6 weeks, and that I should follow up by calling the IRS if I don't receive a response by then.

# Takeaways

- As the issue is unfolding, document things by e.g. asking questions on Quora, Stack Exchange, and so forth.
This will create material that others can find if they are in a similar situation.
- When calling a phone service, persistence pays off.
In particular, don't hang up until the issue is fully resolved.
Yes, the person you are talking to may sound exasperated, but at least when dealing with the IRS, [you have the right](https://www.irs.gov/taxpayer-bill-of-rights) to have this resolved.
Even after they answered my initial question, I repeatedly said "Could I have a moment to think? I might have another question."

# Timeline

April
:   Didn't manage to finish filing tax return; penalty amount small so it wasn't a big deal.

May
:   Filed tax return.

June 21
:   Received CP14 notice from the IRS (notice dated June 20).

June 28
:   Called the IRS for the first time to tell them I disagreed with the amount due notice (CP14), using the number they provided on the CP14 for disagreements with the amount due.
During the call I realized my mistake, and that the failure-to-file and failure-to-pay penalties shouldn't have been on line 79.
The IRS representative told me they had to honor my initial filing of Form 1040.
I asked on which line the penalty *should* have been listed; the representative told me to look in IRS Publication 17 (288 pages long), but could not cite a paragraph.
I asked to talk to somebody more senior, but was denied my request.
I asked what I should do next to correct this issue, but was told they could not help me, and that I would have to call in again.
I later looked in Publication 17 but could not locate this information in a reasonable amount of time.

June 28
:   I asked ["Where is payment for failure-to-file and failure-to-pay penalties included on Form 1040?"](http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/66741/where-is-payment-for-failure-to-file-and-failure-to-pay-penalties-included-on-fo) on Finance & Money Stack Exchange.

June 29
:   I asked ["If I incorrectly included my failure-to-file penalty on line 79 of Form 1040, how should I amend this?"](https://www.quora.com/If-I-incorrectly-included-my-failure-to-file-penalty-on-line-79-of-Form-1040-how-should-I-amend-this) on Quora and ["How should Form 1040 be amended if error was introduced on lines 78 and 79?"](http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/66793/how-should-form-1040-be-amended-if-error-was-introduced-on-lines-78-and-79) on Finance & Money Stack Exchange.
I decided to wait a day to see if a definitive answer emerged.

July 1
:   I called the IRS, but did not manage to receive a human response as described above in the page.
I then called the TAS.

[^tax_2015]: Tax year 2015 was the first year for which I filed a return, because I had made money doing content creation work under Vipul Naik.
