This page is my review of my first year at University of Washington
(which I currently attend as an undergraduate student).  If you want to
see separate reviews for each quarter during the year, check out my
quarterly reviews, which in turn point to my course reviews:

- [Autumn](autumn-2014-at-the-university-of-washington)
- [Winter](winter-2015-at-the-university-of-washington)
- [Spring](spring-2015-at-the-university-of-washington)

The overall emotional tone for me so far has been extremely negative.
No doubt this is partly due to some ongoing personal problems, as well as the disappointment and stress from coursework.
My first year was spent essentially completing prerequisites for admission to the computer science major, and as such I did not learn much academically (e.g. intro programming, mechanics, proof-based single-variable calculus were all topics I had explored previously).
That isn't to say I didn't learn anything academically: I still learned in math courses I took in the latter two quarters, namely differential equations in [MATH 135]() and rigorous linear algebra in [MATH 136](); I also knew close to nothing about climate modelling so everything in [ATM S 559]() was new.

I'd also like to note that during this year I felt increasingly alienated by academic work.
During high school, although I could not tolerate the tedious work in classes, I still wished to excel academically by self-studying outside of school.
However, this was the first year where my impatience with academics overwhelmed my curiosity.
My greater involvement in various online communities, combined with starting the [Cause Prioritization Wiki](http://causeprioritization.org/) (with guidance from [Vipul Naik](http://vipulnaik.com/)) made me realized that I could in fact "learn by doing" to a greater extent than what I had been doing.
(Until this year I had mostly been trying to "build myself up" by becoming competent academically, putting off actually doing anything until later.)
