# Introduction

Here I try to isolate and itemize claims that come up in the "DDT debate".
I then list the main overall positions I see on the topic, and which of these
claims one must take to believe these positions.

# Claims

1. DDT has been banned for pesticide use in many (malaria-endemic) countries.
2. DDT has been banned for use in malaria control in many (malaria-endemic)
   countries.
3. Wide resistance to DDT by mosquitoes exists.
4. Wide resistance to DDT by mosquitoes is caused mainly by its agricultural
   use, rather than its mosquito insecticide use.
5. DDT use against mosquitoes has significantly waned.
