- linking leads to people feeling the urge to link -- like a scholar feeling an urge to cite as many things as they can so they seem more knowledgeable; also some form of the sunk cost fallacy, where they don't want to *not* use something they've found. (see colewb)
- "once you have an acronym, everything looks like a compliment or an insult"
- linking to catchy titles/phrases changes their meaning (there once was comment on LW about this)
