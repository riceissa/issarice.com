[arbtt](http://arbtt.nomeata.de/) is the "automatic, rule-based time tracker".
It is a time-tracking program that runs in the background, recording which
windows are open, which window has focus, and so on.
It has a separate `arbtt-stats` command that displays the recorded information
in various ways -- the user is expected to write suitable rules so that the
summary is interesting.

The documentation is pretty good, and will give an idea of what it can do:
