[^kinks]: I really enjoy Ray Davies' cynical worldview.
See songs like "Sitting in my Hotel", "Supersonic Rocket Ship" (I read this as an indictment of modernity's populism/PC culture: "Nobody's gonna travel second class / There'll be equality / And no suppression of minorities"), "Celluloid Heroes", "Waterloo Sunset" (okay, this one is just sweet), "Apeman", "Autumn Almanac", "Little Miss Queen Of Darkness", "People Take Pictures of Each Other", "The Hard Way", "Afternoon Tea", "Wonderboy", "I'm On An Island".

I also like some simple Japanese songs like [ゴンドラの唄](!wja) ([Gondola no Uta](!w)), [Aogeba Tōtoshi](!w) and [赤とんぼ (童謡)](!wja) (Red Dragonfly).

I also like João Gilberto's [*Chega de Saudade* album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chega_de_Saudade_(album)) (even though I've never bothered to look up any of the lyrics besides the title track's) and Antonio Carlos Jobim's [*Stone Flower*](!w Stone Flower (album)).
I'm a huge fan of the Bossa Nova Japanification Project ([ボサノヴァ日本語化計画](http://hiyokomame.com/ottnet/bossa/translation.htm)).

I do sometimes wonder why I don't listen as much to Japanese music.
It may be that since I've spent all my teenage years (when I first got interested in listening to music) in the US, my musical tastes were influenced that way.

I'm open to suggestions (e.g. sometimes [Kristin Lie](https://www.quora.com/Kristin-Lie) will show me a song), but I feel I've mostly discovered what I like, so I don't spend time actively searching for new things to listen to.
Finding more Japanese songs I like would be especially nice though.

I should also mention that I can go for long periods (weeks) without listening to any music.
It might just be that my collection is so small I get bored of it quickly, but can come back to it after some amount of time has passed.

Some others:

- "Dream A Little Dream of Me"---Ella Fitzgerald, Doris Day
- Taylor Swift---"Blank Space", "22", "Back to December", "The Way I Loved You", "Forever and Always", "Ours", "Red", "Our Song"
- [Put Your Records On](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/corinnebaileyrae/putyourrecordson.html) by Corinne Bailey Rae
- Neon Genesis Evangelion OST
- Wings Of Honneamise OST
- "She's 22" by Norah Jones
- RahXephon OST (the classical tracks)
- Hyouka OST
- Hilary Hahn (via Andrew Ho)
- Pokemon OSTs, in particular the Ruby and Sapphire OST

(I plan to make a table like the following to better keep track of my music.
For me, music often allows me to experience the *qualia* of certain periods of my life, so it's important that the time periods when I listened to the music are listed alongside it.)

# Late 2008

I believe I got a second generation iPod Touch right around when it came out,
which seems to be [late
2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch#Models); this is the only Apple
product I ever bought.
This isn't directly about the music I listened to, but I mention this because
(1) this means my interest in music began around or before this point in time;
and (2) I remember the songs I put on that iPod.
I am sure I listened to Queen, and pretty sure but less confident about Led
Zeppelin and The Beatles.

# October 2010

* Pink Floyd

# March 2011

* Bob Dylan (Highway 61 Revisited)

# August 2011

This is the summer before starting at Inglemoor; I remember constantly
listening to Bob Dylan (specifically *Blonde on Blonde* and *Highway 61
Revisited*.

# December 2012

The Cure and *Pet Sounds* as early as this point in time.

# December 2014

Discovered Fishmans, originally through a Quora answer.
The full story is: on December 11 I spammed Quora with a bunch of questions
like "Which Japanese bands sound a lot like *X*?" for various *X*.
On December 18 Austin Do
[answered](https://www.quora.com/Which-Japanese-bands-sound-a-lot-like-Velvet-Underground/answer/Austin-Do)
the question for Velvet Underground, and I'm almost certain this is what led me
to discover Fishmans.
I remember listening to "Baby Blue" first.
By December 21, I had asked on Quora "What are the best Japanese bands that
sound like Fishmans?"
`stat` shows that I had downloaded the full album videos from YouTube by
December 22 and converted them to MP3.

# 2015

Taylor Swift

# September 2016

  * *Girls und Panzer* OST
  * Ed Sheeran's *x* ("Thinking Out Loud", "The Man")
  * Neil Young's *After The Gold Rush* ("After the Gold Rush")

# October 2016

  * Blur, after seeing it mentioned in a [Facebook comment by Sebastian
    Nickel][seb_com]. So far I like *Parklife* the best.

# November 2016

  * The past several days I have been listening to *Please Please Me* on loop.
    There is something special about this album that is not present in any of
    the other early Beatles albums.
  * "I Don't Want to Know" by Fleetwood Mac

# December 2016

  * *OK Computer* disc 2; these tracks seem to be listed only in some deluxe or
    [special](https://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-OK-Computer-Special-Collectors-Edition/release/1705062)
    editions
  * The Pillows: *Happy Bivouac* ("Funny Bunny", "Back Seat Dog", "Crazy
    Sunshine"), *Runners High* ("Runners High"), "この世の果てまで" (sounds a
    lot like a traditional Japanese song or something by the Blue Hearts that I
    can't remember; I like the YO-KING version)

# History

This was originally written as an answer to the Quora question "[What music does Issa Rice listen to?](!q)"

The page started out as a collection of music I like to listen to, but considering that my tastes have drifted with the passing of time, I felt it more appropriate to make it a list of music I at one point in time liked listening to.
