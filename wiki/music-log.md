[^kinks]: I really enjoy Ray Davies' cynical worldview.
See songs like "Sitting in my Hotel", "Supersonic Rocket Ship" (I read this as an indictment of modernity's populism/PC culture: "Nobody's gonna travel second class / There'll be equality / And no suppression of minorities"), "Celluloid Heroes", "Waterloo Sunset" (okay, this one is just sweet), "Apeman", "Autumn Almanac", "Little Miss Queen Of Darkness", "People Take Pictures of Each Other", "The Hard Way", "Afternoon Tea", "Wonderboy", "I'm On An Island".

I also like some simple Japanese songs like [ゴンドラの唄](!wja) ([Gondola no Uta](!w)), [Aogeba Tōtoshi](!w) and [赤とんぼ (童謡)](!wja) (Red Dragonfly).

I also like João Gilberto's [*Chega de Saudade* album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chega_de_Saudade_(album)) (even though I've never bothered to look up any of the lyrics besides the title track's) and Antonio Carlos Jobim's [*Stone Flower*](!w Stone Flower (album)).
I'm a fan of the Bossa Nova Japanification Project ([ボサノヴァ日本語化計画](http://hiyokomame.com/ottnet/bossa/translation.htm)).

I do sometimes wonder why I don't listen as much to Japanese music.
It may be that since I've spent all my teenage years (when I first got interested in listening to music) in the US, my musical tastes were influenced that way.

I'm open to suggestions (e.g. sometimes [Kristin Lie](https://www.quora.com/Kristin-Lie) will show me a song), but I feel I've mostly discovered what I like, so I don't spend time actively searching for new things to listen to.
Finding more Japanese songs I like would be especially nice though.

I should also mention that I can go for long periods (weeks) without listening to any music.
It might just be that my collection is so small I get bored of it quickly, but can come back to it after some amount of time has passed.

Some others:

- "Dream A Little Dream of Me"---Ella Fitzgerald, Doris Day
- Taylor Swift---"Blank Space", "Back to December", "Forever and Always", "Ours", "Red"
- Neon Genesis Evangelion OST
- Pokemon OSTs, in particular the Ruby and Sapphire OST

(I plan to make a table like the following to better keep track of my music.
For me, music often allows me to experience the *qualia* of certain periods of my life, so it's important that the time periods when I listened to the music are listed alongside it.)

Hozier: _Hozier_ (not sure when I started listening to this album, but I repeatedly come back to it)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time period      Music

2007 or 2008 (?)    Queen

before 2016      I mostly listen to mainstream Western music from a few
                 decades back: Bob Dylan^["Bob Dylan's 115th Dream", "It's
                 Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)", "Visions of Johanna", "Stuck
                 Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again", "Just Like a
                 Woman", "Subterranean Homesick Blues", "Mr.  Tambourine Man",
                 "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue", "I Want You",  "Highway 61
                 Revisited", "Ballad of a Thin Man", and many more.], The
                 Beatles, Pink Floyd, The Kinks[^kinks], Led Zeppelin, Jimi
                 Hendrix, Velvet Underground (roughly in that order).  [Jean Michel Jarre](!w), [Jean-Luc Ponty](!w),
                 mostly through my father.

2013 or 2014     [Sidi Touré](!w), [Detektivbyrån](!w)

2015-12 (?) to   Sunny Day Service
2016-02 (?)      (band): "aitakatta shoujo", "baby blue",

# Late 2008

I believe I got a second generation iPod Touch right around when it came out,
which seems to be [late
2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch#Models); this is the only Apple
product I ever bought.
This isn't directly about the music I listened to, but I mention this because
(1) this means my interest in music began around or before this point in time;
and (2) I remember the songs I put on that iPod.
I am sure I listened to Queen, and pretty sure but less confident about Led
Zeppelin and The Beatles.

# October 2010

# March 2011

Revisited*).

# December 2012

# December 2014

Discovered Fishmans, originally through a Quora answer.
The full story is: on December 11 I spammed Quora with a series of questions
of the form "Which Japanese bands sound a lot like *X*?" for various *X*.
On December 18, Austin Do
[answered](https://www.quora.com/Which-Japanese-bands-sound-a-lot-like-Velvet-Underground/answer/Austin-Do)
the question for Velvet Underground, and I'm almost certain this is what led me
to discover Fishmans.
I remember listening to "Baby Blue" first.
By December 21, I had asked on Quora "What are the best Japanese bands that
sound like Fishmans?"
`stat` shows that I had downloaded the full album videos from YouTube by
December 22 and converted them to MP3.

"頼りない天使", "バックビートにのっかって", and also their later albums:
*空中キャンプ*, *宇宙 日本 世田谷*, *ORANGE*.

Also discovered Allah-Las, especially the album _Allah-Las_.

* Etsuko Yakushimaru: _Radio Onsen Eutopia_
* Sōtaisei Riron: _Hi-Fi Anatomia_

# October 2018

* I've been listening a lot to _Rubber Soul_ (The Beatles) lately. This time
  around, I am really liking "Girl".
* Kinoko Teikoku (きのこ帝国): I just discovered this band in my YouTube
  recommendations. Still too early to say if I will continue listening to them,
  but I am hooked on their general sound. Sort of a mix between Fishmans and
  Sunny Day Service, but worse than both. Still, I like it.

# January 2019

* Sōtaisei Riron: _Chiffonism_
* Deerhoof: _The Magic_ (HT Alex Sanchez); my favorite track so far is
  "Life is Suffering"
* For some reason, I am enjoying Radiohead's _Hail to the Thief_ a lot
  this month. Previously, I thought it was one of Radiohead's worst
  albums (along with _Amnesiac_, although with _Amnesiac_ I was able
  to eventually enjoy it more).

# May 2019

* Houseki no Kuni (Land of the Lustrous) OST

# November 2019

* Serial Experiments Lain OST -- I had listened to this several times back when I watched the anime (I forget when), but it didn't make much of an impression back then (to the point where I didn't even record it on this page). I decided to revisit it and find it more interesting now.

# January 2020

* Gentle Giant (HT Alex Sanchez) -- I had heard of this band's name, but had never listened to them before (or if I did, I forgot about it).
  * _The Power and the Glory_
  * _Octopus_
  * _Free Hand_

# February 2020

* Sean Lennon: _Friendly Fire_ -- this album is surprisingly good (on priors, I
  just expected Sean Lennon to not be very good, so had avoided him; it's only
  thanks to YouTube's recommendation feature that I even listened to this in
  the first place)

# March 2020

* "Valor Lakefront" (Pokemon Diamond and Pearl) -- I got hooked on this song for a few days, listening to the extended/looped version of it on YouTube. I slightly prefer the nighttime version.

# May 2020

* "TICK TACK" (_Mind Game_ OST) -- I actually watched _Mind Game_ a few years ago, but never go into the OST then (most of the tracks are difficult to listen to). I found this track via ["Best Of Masaaki Yuasa Anime OST - Chill Mix To Study/Relax To"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tonYj30Qh4o) while searching around for Tatami Galaxy tracks.

# June 2020

* Weezer: Blue Album -- I had heard this many years ago but recently remembered it and decided to listen to it again. It was interesting to listen to it around three times, but I quickly got bored of it.
* Theme from _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_
* "Someone Else's Forward Motion (Posing As Your Own)" from _Synecdoche, New York_ OST

# July 2020

* The Shins: _Oh, Inverted World_ (HT _Garden State_ -- I only watched clips of the movie)

# August 2020

* Tarkine Funk: ["Incessantly"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znz9XXZGU74) (HT Satira)
* Smuff Tha Quiz: ["Dawn"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6OQpqDDZVI) (HT Satira)
* This month I've been listening to _Revolver_ again a lot, and am especially enjoying "And Your Bird Can Sing" for the first time (it has always seemed to me like one of those low quality Lennon songs, but I like it now for some reason).

# September 2020

* Jon Brion: "He Needs Me" (_Punch-Drunk Love_ OST)

# November 2020

* 港が見える丘 (I like the version sung by 平野愛子 best)
* Rinocerose: "Machine Pour Les Oreilles"

# December 2020

* "Lullaby Set" from the _Braid_ soundtrack

# February 2021

* Sara Bareilles:
  * "Love Song" -- I'd known about this song for a long time, but I'm only now
    getting around to really enjoying it.
  * "Bottle It Up"
* _Braid_ soundtrack

# March 2021

* _Your Name_ soundtrack (especially "Dream Lantern" and "Itomori High School")

# History

This was originally written as an answer to the Quora question "[What music does Issa Rice listen to?](!q)"

The page started out as a collection of music I like to listen to, but considering that my tastes have drifted with the passing of time, I felt it more appropriate to make it a list of music I at one point in time liked listening to.
