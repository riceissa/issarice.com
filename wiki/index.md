This is the website of myself, Issa Rice. This site stores biographical information
about me, but it is also a personal wiki or [open notebook](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html)
of sorts; anything that doesn't belong elsewhere ends up on here, and as a
result the content on here can be of admittedly low-quality: unfinished,
written in multiple voices over the span of years, wrong, or otherwise unsuitable for public
consumption. Embarrassing as it is, I like to "think and work in the open" so
others can benefit from my thoughts and critique them.

# Summary of what I worked on: May 2018 {#summary}

For completed tasks, see the [work]() page.

This month I spent a lot of time learning math so only spent about 64 hours on
contract work.

I completed timelines for [OpenAI](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_OpenAI)
and [CHAI](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Center_for_Human-Compatible_AI),
two AI safety organizations.

I did more work on the Cause Prioritization Wiki. Most of the work was about
how to [classify cause
areas](https://causeprioritization.org/Cause_area_classification) better.

I also did more work on Vipul Naik's [Donations List
Website](https://donations.vipulnaik.com), importing more donations data.

I completed adding historical data for [MIRI staff
members](https://aiwatch.issarice.com/?organization=Machine+Intelligence+Research+Institute),
and added three new table views on AI Watch ("Staff count by year", "Number of
full-time staff at the beginning each year", and "Full history of additions and
subtractions" on that page).

I did some work on [Timeline of Google Brain](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Google_Brain).
