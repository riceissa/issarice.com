This is the website of myself, Issa Rice.
This site stores basic information about me, but it is also a personal wiki or
[open notebook](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html) of sorts
(in some sense, anything that doesn't belong elsewhere ends up on here).

# Summary of what I've been working on: December 2016

This month I've been continuing work on [global
health](global-public-health-notes); in particular, I'm trying to get a
high-level understanding of what has happened so far with
[malaria](malaria-notes).

Separately I've also been working on a mini-project to profile various
researchers.
At the moment my work on this mini-project isn't public but I hope to release
most of it soon.
