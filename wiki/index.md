# Summary of what I've been working on: February 2017

I began the latter half of January by writing up an [essay contest about
evaluating small-scale giving opportunities](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/16e/essay_contest_general_considerations_for/).

I ended January and began February with several [global
health](global-public-health-notes)-related tasks:

* I cleaned up the page on [Gavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavi,_the_Vaccine_Alliance)
  to make the rebranding clear.
* I fixed dead links and added some events to [Timeline of global health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_global_health).
* I added a [reception section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Health_Metrics_and_Evaluation#Reception)
  to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation page.
* I updated the page on [Iodine Global Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_Global_Network)
  to make the renaming clear.
* I significantly expanded the page on [Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_Center_for_Health_Security)
  and made the renaming history clear.
* I significantly expanded the page on the [Global Burden of Disease Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Burden_of_Disease_Study);
  the page actually used to be called "Global burden of disease", but this
  naming was confusing since the page was about the study.

More recently, I worked on some [grants tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Riceissa/Laura_and_John_Arnold_Foundation_grants_tables)
for the Laura and John Arnold Foundation grants tables page; unfortunately an
editor removed them so they are currently only available in user space.

I've also been working on a [collection of scripts](https://github.com/riceissa/wikidossier)
to help analyze various activities on Wikipedia.
