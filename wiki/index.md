This is the website of myself, Issa Rice. This site stores biographical information
about me, but it is also a personal wiki or [open notebook](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html)
of sorts; anything that doesn't belong elsewhere ends up on here, and as a
result the content on here can be of admittedly low-quality: unfinished,
written in multiple voices over the span of years, wrong, or otherwise unsuitable for public
consumption. Embarrassing as it is, I like to "think and work in the open" so
others can benefit from my thoughts and critique them.

# Summary of what I worked on: April 2018 {#summary}

For completed tasks, see the [work page](work).

I did more work on the Cause Prioritization Wiki. Most of the work was about
how to [classify cause
areas](https://causeprioritization.org/Cause_area_classification) better.

I also did more work on Vipul Naik's [Donations List
Website](https://donations.vipulnaik.com), in particular on covering [grant
process](https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations/issues/11), continuing the
transition from commas to pipes as a delimiter, and recording donations of
miscellaneous people.

On Wikipedia Views, I helped to get the [new monthly clickstream data
incorporated](https://github.com/vipulnaik/wikipediaviews/issues/21).

In the interest of making conversations public, I wrote up my notes on
[taxonomies](). These notes started out as a Facebook Messenger chat group in
June 2017 where I sent links and ideas related to taxonomies.

I continued to do some work on a series of wiki pages about specific
individuals, mostly those involved in the [effective altruism]() movement and
the [rationality community](). This work is not public, but a subset of the
work may eventually be made public, and the work is intended to help with
public writeups in the future. This work is funded by Vipul Naik.
