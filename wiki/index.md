This is the website of myself, Issa Rice. This site stores biographical information
about me, but it is also a personal wiki or [open notebook](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html)
of sorts; anything that doesn't belong elsewhere ends up on here, and as a
result the content on here can be of admittedly low-quality: unfinished,
written in multiple voices over the span of years, wrong, or otherwise unsuitable for public
consumption. Embarrassing as it is, I like to "think and work in the open" so
others can benefit from my thoughts and critique them.

# Summary of what I worked on: November 2017 {#summary}

For completed tasks, see the [work page](work).

In addition, during November I did more work on Vipul Naik's Development
Economics Subwiki. You can see [my contributions](https://devec.subwiki.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Issa_Rice).

I continued work on importing data for the Devec/Demography Data Portal (mostly country name normalization and trying to get all region/metric/year/units/dataset combinations to be unique in the database). One new repository here is [devec_sql_common](https://github.com/riceissa/devec_sql_common), which has some common code for working with all the datasets.

I also began work on a [Computing Data Project](https://github.com/riceissa/computing-data-project) (to be funded by Vipul Naik). Here I've mostly been reading about different cloud computing services and trying to come up with a database schema, so there isn't much to see yet.

I also [opened a bunch of issues](https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations/issues/created_by/riceissa) on Vipul Naik's Donations List Website repo. Previously our list of things to work on was stored as instant messaging messages, so these issues will make it easier to get an overview of things to work on. The plan is that eventually someone (probably me) will come and complete these tasks.
