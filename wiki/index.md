This is the website of myself, Issa Rice. This site stores biographical information
about me, but it is also a personal wiki or [open notebook](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html)
of sorts; anything that doesn't belong elsewhere ends up on here, and as a
result the content on here can be of admittedly low-quality: unfinished,
written in multiple voices over the span of years, wrong, or otherwise unsuitable for public
consumption. Embarrassing as it is, I like to "think and work in the open" so
others can benefit from my thoughts and critique them.

# Summary of what I worked on: September 2018 {#summary}

For completed tasks, see the [work]() page.

I spent some time adding to Vipul Naik's Learning Subwiki. You can see
[my contributions for the month](https://learning.subwiki.org/w/index.php?limit=150&title=Special%3AContributions&contribs=user&target=Issa+Rice&namespace=&tagfilter=&year=2018&month=9).

I started on an analysis for pageviews of wikiHow articles. (No public output
of this yet.)

On the last day of the month, I began a wikiHow article about
[Facebook's graph search](https://github.com/riceissa/issarice.com/blob/master/external/wikihow.com/facebook-graph-search.mediawiki).

I spent some time writing some [pages](https://machinelearning.subwiki.org/w/index.php?limit=120&title=Special%3AContributions&contribs=user&target=IssaRice&namespace=&tagfilter=&year=2018&month=9)
on Vipul Naik's Machine Learning Subwiki, although the pages are mostly in my
userspace and are not related to machine learning. (The wiki was just a
convenient place to store the writings for now.)

I spent most of the month learning about things related to AI alignment.
(I am still wondering how best to make progress on this more visible.)
