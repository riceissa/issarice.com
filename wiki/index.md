This is the website of Issa Rice.
This site stores basic information about myself, but it is also a personal wiki of sorts (in some sense, everything that doesn't belong elsewhere ends up on here, and as a result some of it can be admittedly low-quality).
Below are some pages that may be of interest:

- [About me](); [contact]() me
- [About this site](./about-the-site)
- "[Content creation]()" documents my ongoing research on the organization and dissemination of knowledge, how to effectively publish content online, and how much one can impact the world by publishing such content.
- "[Resources for the University of Washington]()" might be a good place to look for those who attend or want to attend the University of Washington.
- I am very slowly trying to catalog broad areas of the [effective altruism]() movement on "[Effective altruism links]()".
I also maintain the [Cause Prioritization Wiki](http://causeprioritization.org).
- [Notes on computing](_tags/computing) (Linux, programming, etc.)
- [Notes on math](_tags/math)
- [Quora](): [My Quora answers]()
- One can also view a list of [all tags used on this site](_tags/index) and a list of [all pages on this site](_all).
