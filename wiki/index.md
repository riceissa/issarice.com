This is the website of myself, Issa Rice. This site stores biographical information
about me, but it is also a personal wiki or [open notebook](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html)
of sorts; anything that doesn't belong elsewhere ends up on here, and as a
result the content on here can be of admittedly low-quality: unfinished,
written in multiple voices over the span of years, wrong, or otherwise unsuitable for public
consumption. Embarrassing as it is, I like to "think and work in the open" so
others can benefit from my thoughts and critique them.

# Summary of what I worked on: February and March 2019 {#summary}

In case you were wondering, I got lazy at the end of February and didn't update
this section, so I am bundling together February and March.

For completed tasks, see the [work]() page.

I've been working towards an explanation of Solomonoff induction; see
[Solomonoff induction](https://machinelearning.subwiki.org/wiki/Solomonoff_induction) and
[Variants of Solomonoff induction](https://machinelearning.subwiki.org/wiki/Variants_of_Solomonoff_induction)
for a work-in-progress.

I spent some time adding to Vipul Naik's Learning Subwiki. You can see
[my contributions for February](https://learning.subwiki.org/w/index.php?limit=100&title=Special%3AContributions&contribs=user&target=Issa+Rice&namespace=&tagfilter=&year=2019&month=02) (I didn't make any edits there during March).

For my edits to my userspace on the Machine Learning Subwiki, see
[February](https://machinelearning.subwiki.org/w/index.php?limit=215&title=Special%3AContributions&contribs=user&target=IssaRice&namespace=2&associated=1&tagfilter=&year=2019&month=02) and
[March](https://machinelearning.subwiki.org/w/index.php?limit=40&title=Special%3AContributions&contribs=user&target=IssaRice&namespace=2&associated=1&tagfilter=&year=2019&month=03).

I spent most of February and March learning about things related to AI alignment. See my
[daily updates blog](https://issarice.wordpress.com/) for updates about most of February.
I decided to stop blogging there because preparing the updates turned out to be
annoying and without clear benefits.  If there is demand for this sort of
updates I would be open to re-starting the blog.
I'm also hoping to transition into being more output-oriented in AI alignment, with my
[recent decision theory post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QPhY8Nb7gtT5wvoPH/comparison-of-decision-theories-with-a-focus-on-logical) marking the start of this.

For previous monthly updates, see the [archive of my monthly updates]().
