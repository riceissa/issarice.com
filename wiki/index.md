# Summary of what I've been working on: December 2016

This month I've been continuing work on [global
health](global-public-health-notes); in particular, I'm trying to get a
high-level understanding of what has happened so far with
[malaria](malaria-notes).

Separately I've also been working on a mini-project to profile various
researchers.
At the moment my work on this mini-project isn't public but I hope to release
most of it soon.
