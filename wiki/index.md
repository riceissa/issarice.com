This is the website of myself, Issa Rice.  This site stores basic information
about me, but it is also a personal wiki or [open notebook](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html) of sorts (in some sense,
anything that doesn't belong elsewhere ends up on here, and as a result
some of the content on here can be admittedly of low-quality).  Below are
some pages that may be of interest:

- [About me](about) (contains a short self-introduction)
- [Contact information and account names I use on various websites](contact)
- [About this site](about-this-site)
- Most recently, I've been doing a lot of [Wikipedia](wikipedia) editing.
- I maintain the [Cause Prioritization Wiki](http://causeprioritization.org) (external site).
- [Content creation]() documents my ongoing research on the
  organization and dissemination of knowledge, how to effectively
  publish content online, and how much one can impact the world by
  publishing such content.
- My pages related to the [University of Washington](university-of-washington).
- I am very slowly trying to catalog broad areas of the [effective altruism]() movement on [Effective altruism links]().
- [Notes on computing](computing) (Linux, programming, etc.)
- [Notes on math](math)
- [Pages related to education](education)
- [Quora](): a mirror of [my Quora answers]()
