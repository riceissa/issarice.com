This is the website of Issa Rice.  This site stores basic information
about myself, but it is also a personal wiki of sorts (in some sense,
anything that doesn't belong elsewhere ends up on here, and as a result
some of the content on here can be admittedly low-quality).  Below are
some pages that may be of interest:

- [About me]() (contains a short self-introduction); [contact]() me
- [About this site](./about-the-site)
- I maintain the [Cause Prioritization Wiki][cpw] (external site)
- [Content creation]() documents my ongoing research on the
  organization and dissemination of knowledge, how to effectively
  publish content online, and how much one can impact the world by
  publishing such content.
- [Resources for the University of Washington]() might be a good
  place to look for those who attend or want to attend the University of
  Washington.
- I am very slowly trying to catalog broad areas of the [effective
  altruism]() movement on [Effective altruism links]().
- [Notes on computing](_tags/computing) (Linux, programming, etc.)
- [Notes on math](_tags/math)
- [Quora](): a mirror of [my Quora answers]()
- One can also view a list of [all tags used on this site](_tags/index)
  and a list of [all pages on this site](_all).
