# Summary of what I worked on: September 2017 {#summary}

For completed tasks, see the [work page](work).

In addition, during September I spent time learning about and taking notes on
development economics. You can see [my contributions](https://devec.subwiki.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Issa_Rice)
on Vipul Naik's Development Economics Subwiki as well as a [Summary table of
views on development economics](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Summary_table_of_views_on_development_economics)
that I started on Timelines Wiki (that will be moved to Development Economics
Subwiki soon).

I also spent some time working on a [Timeline of the rationality community](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_the_rationality_community),
but this is not yet complete.

I started a [Timeline of decision theory](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_decision_theory)
that I hope to complete at some point.

I've been spending quite a bit of time reading about consciousness lately. I
hope to begin producing some output from this soon but I am still figuring out
my options.
