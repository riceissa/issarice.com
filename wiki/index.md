This is the website of myself, Issa Rice. This site stores biographical information
about me, but it is also a personal wiki or [open notebook](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html)
of sorts; anything that doesn't belong elsewhere ends up on here, and as a
result the content on here can be of admittedly low-quality: unfinished,
written in multiple voices over the span of years, wrong, or otherwise unsuitable for public
consumption. Embarrassing as it is, I like to "think and work in the open" so
others can benefit from my thoughts and critique them.

# Summary of what I worked on: November 2018 {#summary}

For completed tasks, see the [work]() page.

I spent some time adding to Vipul Naik's Learning Subwiki. You can see
[my contributions for the month](https://learning.subwiki.org/w/index.php?limit=150&title=Special%3AContributions&contribs=user&target=Issa+Rice&namespace=&tagfilter=&year=2018&month=11).

I learned about the GraphQL API (used on the new LessWrong 2.0 and EA Forum),
and wrote a simple reader for both [LessWrong 2.0](https://lw2.issarice.com/)
and [EA Forum](https://eaforum.issarice.com/). The source code is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/riceissa/ea-forum-reader). I am also writing a
[tutorial](https://github.com/riceissa/ea-forum-reader/blob/master/tutorial.md)
because I found the learning process pretty painful and want to help other
people use the API.

I spent most of the month learning about things related to AI alignment. I
started a new [blog](https://issarice.wordpress.com/) to track updates on this
front.

For previous monthly updates, see the [archive of my monthly updates]().
