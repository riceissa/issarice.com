# Summary of what I've been working on: January 2017

This month I've been continuing work on [global
health](global-public-health-notes); in particular, I'm trying to get a
high-level understanding of what has happened so far with
[malaria](malaria-notes).
Some related Wikipedia pages I'm working on are [Comparison of methods of
malaria
control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Riceissa/Comparison_of_methods_of_malaria_control),
[Comparison of measures of abundance of
malaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Riceissa/Comparison_of_measures_of_abundance_of_malaria),
and [Human-landing
catch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Riceissa/Human-landing_catch).

At the beginning of the month I published [Timeline of digital
preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_digital_preservation).
