# Summary of what I worked on: March 2017 {#summary}

I started the month by continuing with improvements to tech company timelines,
in particular [timeline of Reddit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Reddit)
and [timeline of GitHub](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_GitHub).

Due to community hostility, Vipul Naik's Wikipedia project (on which I
collaborated significantly) was suspended during March.
Since a large part of our work on Wikipedia was in the form of timelines, I did
the work of migrating our timelines content to a self-hosted wiki, now
available as the [Timelines
Wiki](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Main_Page).
In the process of setting up the new wiki, I found a lack of good
documentation, so I also [wrote up some
notes](https://github.com/riceissa/nginx-mediawiki/) on that.

I wrote a [small script](https://github.com/riceissa/arnold-foundation-grants/blob/master/loop.py)
to help process Arnold Foundation grants for Vipul Naik.

I also made more improvements to
[Wikidossier](https://github.com/riceissa/wikidossier).

March in general was rather stressful because of what happened with Wikipedia:
as mentioned above, our project was suspended and [my account was indefinitely
blocked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive948#Riceissa).
To cope better with the situation, I took a "vacation" starting around March
23 that lasted until the end of the month.
