# Summary of what I worked on: June 2017 {#summary}

Payment details of a [hits-based giving project](https://gist.github.com/riceissa/186b1d2e8bbb85e6204b5e06aba64018)
I worked on a few months ago was finalized at the beginning of the month.
For context, see the [original post](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/14s/how_many_hits_does_hitsbased_giving_get_a/)
by Peter Hurford.

I completed [timeline of electricity
adoption](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_electricity_adoption),
which I had begun the previous month.

I created a [timeline of Carl Shulman publications](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Carl_Shulman_publications),
which provides an updated and more complete version (taking into account the
diversity of publication formats) of the [timeline Luke
Muehlhauser created](http://lesswrong.com/lw/7ob/timeline_of_carl_shulman_publications/)
some years ago.

I got a good amount of work done on a new [timeline of Bitcoin](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Bitcoin),
which is not yet done.

At the end of the month I started on [timeline of Machine Intelligence Research
Institute](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Machine_Intelligence_Research_Institute)
to get a bit of break from the Bitcoin timeline.
