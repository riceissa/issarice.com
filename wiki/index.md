This is the website of myself, Issa Rice. This site stores biographical information
about me, but it is also a personal wiki or [open notebook](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html)
of sorts; anything that doesn't belong elsewhere ends up on here, and as a
result the content on here can be of admittedly low-quality: unfinished,
written in multiple voices over the span of years, wrong, or otherwise unsuitable for public
consumption. Embarrassing as it is, I like to "think and work in the open" so
others can benefit from my thoughts and critique them.

# Summary of what I worked on: July 2018 {#summary}

For completed tasks, see the [work]() page.

This month I spent a lot of time working on the [Computing Data Project](https://github.com/riceissa/computing-data-project/). It's not ready for public use yet.

I did some work on Vipul Naik's [Machine Learning Subject Wiki](https://machinelearning.subwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page). You can see pages like [Summary table of multivariable derivatives](https://machinelearning.subwiki.org/wiki/Summary_table_of_multivariable_derivatives) and [Derivative of a quadratic form](https://machinelearning.subwiki.org/wiki/Derivative_of_a_quadratic_form).

I learned more decision theory and have a [draft blog post](https://github.com/riceissa/issarice.com/blob/master/external/lesswrong.com/decision-theories-comparison.md) that tries to explain the differences between the various logical decision theories.

I did some work on Vipul's Donations List Website, mostly adding data and working on the [money moved table](https://donations.vipulnaik.com/influencer.php?influencer=GiveWell#influencerMoneyMovedList) (adding the "amount accounted" column).
