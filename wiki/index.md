This is the website of myself, Issa Rice. This site stores biographical information
about me, but it is also a personal wiki or [open notebook](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html)
of sorts; anything that doesn't belong elsewhere ends up on here, and as a
result the content on here can be of admittedly low-quality: unfinished,
written in multiple voices over the span of years, wrong, or otherwise unsuitable for public
consumption. Embarrassing as it is, I like to "think and work in the open" so
others can benefit from my thoughts and critique them.

# Summary of what I worked on: December 2017 {#summary}

For completed tasks, see the [work page](work).

I continued work on importing data for the Devec/Demography Data Portal
(especially trying to speed up the bulk import of all the datasets).

I started work on the [Devec/Demography Data Portal](https://github.com/riceissa/devec-demography-data-portal) (the actual website rather than just obtaining data).
This is still in early stages so there is no public instance that one can view.

I continued doing work on [AI Watch](https://aiwatch.issarice.com/), a website
to track people and organizations in AI safety.

I got some work done on the [Computing Data Project](https://github.com/riceissa/computing-data-project).
It turns out that getting historical EC2 prices is pretty hard to do, so
progress has been slow.

I worked on importing various data sources for Vipul Naik's Donations List
Website. Here is a list of all of them:

- [Public Welfare Foundation](https://github.com/riceissa/public-welfare-foundation)
- [MacArthur Foundation](https://github.com/riceissa/macarthur-foundation)
- [Ford Foundation](https://github.com/riceissa/ford-foundation)
- [Hewlett Foundation](https://github.com/riceissa/hewlett-foundation)
- [Wellcome Trust](https://github.com/riceissa/wellcome-trust)
- [Bauman Foundation](https://github.com/riceissa/bauman-foundation)
- [Unbound Philanthropy](https://github.com/riceissa/unbound-philanthropy)
- [Templeton Foundation](https://github.com/riceissa/templeton-foundation)

In addition, I did coding work for the Donations List Website. This was for
work on incremental donor similarity computation and some other minor changes.
You can see [my commits](https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations/commits?author=riceissa).
