# Summary of what I worked on: June 2017 {#summary}

I worked on some graphing improvements for Wikipedia Views.
Pull requests: [1](https://github.com/vipulnaik/wikipediaviews/pull/18),
[2](https://github.com/vipulnaik/wikipediaviews/pull/19).

I wrote a [timeline of Machine Intelligence Research Institute](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Machine_Intelligence_Research_Institute).

I wrote a [timeline of Center for Applied Rationality](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Center_for_Applied_Rationality).
The timeline is still lacking a big picture.

I wrote a [timeline of friendly artificial intelligence](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_friendly_artificial_intelligence).
The timeline is still lacking a big picture.

For Vipul Naik's donations site, I
[worked on donee deduplication](https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations/tree/donee-deduplication)
(this branch includes automated social media information fetching as well),
[implemented a donor similarity comparison feature](https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations/tree/donor-similarity),
and [expanded the notes column](https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations/tree/notes-col-expansion).
