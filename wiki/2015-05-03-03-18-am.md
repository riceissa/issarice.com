So I have this really bad tendency to just stay up doing nothing except
just some idle thinking. I think it would be better spent doing cause
prioritzation research, or probably even homework (well at least for
some classes that I mildly like).

So I think I employ different types of filtering of thoughts when I
write on different places, and these filters are also different when I
talk to people IRL as well.

Also today I spent a lot of time tinkering with this site's CSS again.
I'm not even sure why I keep doing it.  I ended up making the background
white again... I guess it looks less "silly" and more "serious" that
way.

I do like solarized better in general.  I think it *is* "nicer" on my
eyes, but it might be annoying for some people (it certainly looked odd
the first time I saw it).  But yeah, white/black in general is just a
good default.

Sigh, I'm not even sure if writing these things here, under my real
name, is really actually a good thing or not.  The thing is
though---nobody really reads my website, and they definitely don't go
digging around on it.  So that's what makes me even start writing on
here, I guess.
