So I have this really bad tendency to just stay up doing nothing except
just some idle thinking. I think it would be better spent doing cause
prioritzation research, or probably even homework (well at least for
some classes that I mildly like).

---

So I think I employ different types of filtering of thoughts when I
write on different places, and these filters are also different when I
talk to people IRL as well.

Also today I spent a lot of time tinkering with this site's CSS again.
I'm not even sure why I keep doing it.  I ended up making the background
white again... I guess it looks less "silly" and more "serious" that
way.

I do like solarized better in general.  I think it *is* "nicer" on my
eyes, but it might be annoying for some people (it certainly looked odd
the first time I saw it).  But yeah, white/black in general is just a
good default.

Sigh, I'm not even sure if writing these things here, under my real
name, is really actually a good thing or not.  The thing is
though---nobody really reads my website, and they definitely don't go
digging around on it.  So that's what makes me even start writing on
here, I guess.

Anyway, I really do wonder about the potential for social discovery via
personal websites.  I mean, let's face it: nobody reads people's
personal sites anymore (although I guess I do); it's all on Facebook or
Quora now, or reddit or whatever other site.  Blogs *are* dying,
after all.  But then again, there are sites like gwern's, which, although
they don't get very many views, still have been influential among a few
select groups. 

And in any case, people *do* tell you that revealing emotional things or
secrets or whatever increases people's feelings of closeness to you.
Though maybe that's with selective revealing.  But here's the thing: I
really enjoy reading Amos Yee's blog, for example, even though I haven't
had any direct interaction with him.  And plenty of people have
contacted him; maybe he's even made some friends---all because he wrote
things (and also made videos).  I feel like writing serious
pages/essays, and doing serious work on CP, is one way to have real
impact.  But then there's just writing things that spontaneously come to
your mind, and "inviting" people into your thoughts.  That has a more
select and personal impact, but it's also one that people remember you
more for.

I've been listening a lot of Fishmans lately.  I especially like Neo
Yankees' Holiday; I find it to be an excellent album.  I find these
lines especially mysterious:

> 仔犬と子供 よくわかる仲間 \
> あの外人みたいな髪型で \
> きっと 同じことを考えてるぜ

Also I've been thinking a lot about what makes people seem young.
Obviously there is appearance.  That's  a big part of it.  But even in
just appearance, there are many components to it: how young your face
looks, lack of body hair, lack of facial hair, wearing "children's
clothes", having smooth skin, (possibly) having acne (shows that you are
still a teen).  And then there are behavioral stuff like acting young,
doing cute things, and so forth.  It's kind of hard to balance this all,
and also hard to tell how much each of these contributes to your overall
"evident age", or whatever.
