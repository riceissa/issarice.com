What can "Sure" mean?

  * "If I allow myself to be sufficiently charitable, I can agree with you at
    the object level."
  * "I am objection-handling you and will momentarily change the topic so you
    forget about your point."
  * "I am temporarily agreeing with you on this point so that you can continue
    what you've been wanting to say."
