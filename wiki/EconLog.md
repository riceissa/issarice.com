I really like [EconLog] a lot (mostly the [posts on there by Bryan
Caplan][all_caplan]).  Here I'll maintain a list of posts I especially
like on the blog[^also].  Note that I don't necessarily agree with
what's said in the posts below.

# Treating others (moral lessons)

aka caplan's moral lessions, imparted unto the young!!

- [My Life of Appeasement](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/08/my_life_of_appe_1.html)
- [The Futility of Quarreling When There Is No Surplus to Divide](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/02/the_futility_of.html)

- what can you give your kids? quote about "treating your kids with love
  and respect". judith rich harris quote that goes something like "you
  can't really affect the life outcome of your wife either; so do you
  beat her or do you treat her with the kindness and respect she
  deserves?"

    In *Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids*, Caplan quotes Judith Rich
    Harris in her *The Nurture Assumption*:

    > People sometimes ask me, “So you mean it doesn’t matter how I
    > treat my child?” They never ask, “So you mean it doesn’t matter
    > how I treat my husband or wife?” and yet the situation is similar.
    > I don’t expect that the way I act toward my husband is going to
    > determine what kind of person he will be ten or twenty years from
    > now. I do expect, however, that it will affect how happy he is to
    > live with me and whether we will still be good friends in ten or
    > twenty years.

    Caplan's advice?

    > Raise your children with love, control your temper, and enjoy
    > family time. They’ll appreciate it when they’re children and
    > fondly remember their happy home when they grow up.

    And [again][40things]:

    > Raise your children with kindness and respect. "I'm your parent,
    > not you're friend" is a reason to treat your kids *better* than
    > their peers do, not worse.

- charitability; protestant vs catholic

- [How I Raised My Social Intelligence][social], which has some great
  quotes:

    [social]: http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/06/how_i_raised_my.html

    > In a useful conversation, \[...\] there is a [double coincidence
    > of wants](!w).  You have to be interested in what I have to say; I
    > have to be interested in what you have to say.  This is an
    > important reason why people with conventional interests *seem*
    > more socially intelligent.  Even if they don't check whether their
    > audience cares, it probably does.


    > *Keeping friends is more important than getting your way.* You
    > should think twice before asking anyone for help.  If you still
    > think it's a good idea, try to make your request easy to refuse.
    > "How would you feel about..." is much better than "Please, please
    > just do me this one favor!"  In the short-run, of course, the
    > pushy approach is often effective.  But life is a repeated game,
    > pushing leads to resentment, and your relationships are more
    > valuable than almost any specific victory.

# Amusing ethics of Caplan


- [Where Are the Pro-Life Utilitarians?][abort] is Caplan's take on
  abortion.  Well, actually he doesn't really say if he believes the
  argument or not; it's more of his "refutation" of utilitarianism.

    [abort]: http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/04/where_are_the_p.html

- "[Parenthood as the Trump of All Past Regret][trump]".  The post
  begins: "I don't regret *anything* in my life prior to the conception
  of my sons."

# Miscellaneous

I actually keep finding more and more articles from the Econlog archive that I like, so maybe I'll have to group things by category.

- [The Unsung](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/03/the_unsung.html)

- [The Most I'll Admit](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2017/01/the_most_ill_ad.html) has the quote "My ability to discern human nobility is markedly worse than I thought in 2015. I've probably always been this bad, but 2016 helped me see my limitations clearly."
- [Markets: Rich/Nice vs. Poor/Mean](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2010/06/markets_for_ric.html) -- I keep coming back to this post from time to time
