I use Git to version-control my writings and software.

I tend to use Git both on the command-line as well as in Vim using
[fugitive.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) and
[gv.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/gv.vim).
I also tend to look through commits and other information on GitHub.

Some useful commands:

- View all unadded files, including ones in <code>.gitignore</code>.

    ```bash
    git add -Anf
    ```

    `-A`: all; `-n`: dry run; `-f`: force files in `.gitignore`.

    See [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3801321/git-list-only-untracked-files-also-custom-commands).

- Dealing with submodules

    ```bash
    git submodule update --init 
    git submodule foreach git pull origin master
    ```

    See [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5828324/update-git-submodule) and [here](http://blog.jacius.info/git-submodule-cheat-sheet/).

- [Getting Japanese to display](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4144417/how-to-handle-asian-characters-in-file-names-in-git-on-os-x):

    ```bash
    git config --global core.quotepath false
    ```

- Check when the last revision date for a page on this site was last modified:

    ~~~{.bash}
    git blame -L '/date: /,+1' wiki/PAGENAME.md
    ~~~

# Weird behavior

I'm documenting some weird behavior I've observed.

In `~/.gitconfig`:

```{.bash}
[core]
    pager = less -+S -r
```

Then running `git diff --color 3cc00f112bf~1 3cc00f112bf` in the [CP Wiki repo](https://github.com/riceissa/causeprioritization). This causes colors to show up, but the header doesn't show up at first. If you hit `G` to go to the bottom, then hit `g` to get back up, you can see the header.  You can do some pretty weird things with this, e.g. `git diff --color 3cc00f112bf~1 3cc00f112bf | fold | less -r` will make the color fade out in some regions, and you can also see strange character marks.
