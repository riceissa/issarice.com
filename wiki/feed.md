*This page is about the Atom and RSS feeds for this website. If you're looking for specific social media feeds, see my pages on [[Facebook]] or [[Quora]]; see also my [[contact]] page, where you'll find a list of my various social media accounts.*

I have an [Atom feed](atom.xml) (which is a better version of RSS in my understanding, and should work with almost all RSS readers) for this website where you can get updates (this is probably the best way to get updates, since it includes only the more important changes).

However, since the site's source code is hosted on GitHub, one can also use [GitHub's atom feed for the master branch](https://github.com/riceissa/riceissa.com/commits/master.atom), which includes all updates to pages -- even very incremental ones.

There are also various other Atom/RSS feeds of my online activity:

* [Daily updates blog (mainly about AI safety)](https://issarice.wordpress.com/feed/)
* [Machine Learning Subwiki](https://machinelearning.subwiki.org/w/api.php?action=feedcontributions&user=IssaRice&feedformat=atom)

* [Demography Subwiki](https://demography.subwiki.org/w/api.php?action=feedcontributions&user=IssaRice&feedformat=atom)
* Each GitHub repo has a feed at `https://github.com/riceissa/REPONAME/commits/master.atom` where `REPONAME` should be replaced with the repo name.
