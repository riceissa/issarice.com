As [Muflax says](http://webcitation.org/6DuYcqyQ3):

> I didn’t want to throw away old texts just because I changed my mind, but I also couldn’t let them sit around without an annotation or someone might think I still endorsed them.

In other words, publishing content on one's personal site is not just a statement, but also a meta-statement---that one believes in what is said strongly enough to publish them on one's site.
However, often I like to publish things not because I feel especially confident about them, but just to externalize some ideas.
Therefore using the belief tag to denote how strongly one believes the content on a page seems like a good idea.
I have taken it from gwern, who in turn took it from Muflax.
Since gwern's website is CC0 (public domain), I will just quote his whole [section on belief tags](http://www.gwern.net/About#belief-tags):

> Most of the metadata in each page is self-explanatory: the date is the last time the file was modified, the tags are categorization, etc. The "status" tag describes the state of completion: whether it's a pile of links & snippets & "notes", or whether it is a "draft" which at least has some structure and conveys a coherent thesis, or it's a well-developed draft which could be described as "in progress", and finally when a page is done - in lieu of additional material turning up - it is simply "finished".

> The "belief" tag is a little more unusual. I stole the idea from [Muflax's "epistemic state"](http://webcitation.org/6DuYcqyQ3 "'I wanted a way to show whether I still believe something I have written or not, and if so, how strongly.' (original: http://muflax.com/episteme/)") tags; I use the same meaning for "log" for collections of data or links ("log entries that simply describe what happened without any judgment or reflection") personal or reflective writing can be tagged "emotional" ("some cluster of ideas that got itself entangled with a complex emotional state, and I needed to externalize it to even look at it; in no way endorsed, but occasionally necessary (similar to fiction)"), and "fiction" needs no explanation (every author has *some* reason for writing the story or poem they do, but not even they always know whether it is an expression of their deepest fears, desires, history, or simply random thoughts). I drop his other tags in favor of giving my subjective probability using the ["Kesselman List of Estimative Words"](https://web.archive.org/web/20140130132740/http://www.scip.org/files/Resources/Kesselman-Verbal-Probability-Expressions.pdf "'Verbal probability expressions in National Intelligence Estimates: a comprehensive analysis of trends from the fifties through post 9/11', Kesselman 2008"):
> 
> 1. "certain"
> 2. "highly likely"
> 3. "likely"
> 4. "possible" (my preference over Kesselman's "Chances a Little Better [or Less]")
> 5. "unlikely"
> 6. "highly unlikely"
> 7. "remote"
> 8. "impossible"
> 
> These are used to express my feeling about how well-supported the essay is, or how likely it is the overall ideas are right. (Of course, an interesting idea may be worth writing about even if very wrong, and even a long shot may be profitable to examine if the potential payoff is large enough.)

# Frequency

But now, given these belief tags, one might ask what the frequency of each belief on a site such as this one should be.
Having everything be "certain" to "likely" might be how a typical site or blog operates; i.e. the writer only publishes what they believe.
But this sounds limiting---and this is exactly why belief tags are useful.
But what of the other extreme?---In other words, what if one were to only write what one believed to be false?
A successful such execution would display the writer's creativity, to be sure, but is unlikely to contain much useful information.

One might also ask what the "natural frequency" of each belief might be, if a writer were to log *all* of their thoughts\ ...
