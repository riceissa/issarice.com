In English: /ˈiːsə/ (EE-suh); at least, this is how everyone pronounces
my name now in the US, so I've gotten used to it. However, I should note
that [Robert
Hass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hass) seems to
pronounce it quite differently on here:

[Poetry Everywhere: Robert Hass Translation of Selected Haiku by Kobayashi Issa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl8pRjLSFto)

In Japanese: /isːa/ (いっさ); one can also hear it here (about three to
four seconds in, although he says it about four times throughout the
video):

[小林一茶ここにあり！?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsRGVDjwgR0)

The name is taken from [Kobayashi
Issa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Issa) (and,
incidentally, has just about nothing to do with the Arabic name for
[Jesus in
Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam)). For those
interested in pronouncing it the Japanese way,
[Gemination:Japanese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geminate_consonant#Japanese)
and [Sokuon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokuon)
may also be useful.

Thank you for the A2A. (Someone has suggested to me that Jessica Su sent
the A2A request because she wanted to know if my name could be
pronounced eeeeeeeeee-ssa. If this is the case, then yes, I suppose it
can....)
