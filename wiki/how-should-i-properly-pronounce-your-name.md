In English: /ˈiːsə/ (EE-suh); at least, this is how everyone pronounces
my name now in the US, so I've gotten used to it. However, I should note
that [Robert
Hass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hass) seems to
pronounce it quite differently on here:

[Poetry Everywhere: Robert Hass Translation of Selected Haiku by Kobayashi Issa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl8pRjLSFto)

In Japanese: /isːa/ (いっさ); one can also hear it here (about three to
four seconds in, although he says it about four times throughout the
video):

[小林一茶ここにあり！?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsRGVDjwgR0)

The name is taken from [Kobayashi
Issa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Issa) (and,
incidentally, has just about nothing to do with the Arabic name for
[Jesus in
Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam)). For those
interested in pronouncing it the Japanese way,
[Gemination:Japanese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geminate_consonant#Japanese)
and [Sokuon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokuon)
may also be useful.
