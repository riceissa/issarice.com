# What this page is about

In high school it is common to feel the frustration described in the
introductory paragraph for [Cognito Mentoring]():

> You love learning. You spend a lot of time reading fiction or learning
> about science or solving math problems or all of the above. School
> doesn’t meet your intellectual needs. Classes often emphasize rote
> memorization of disjointed collections of facts. You only know a few
> people who you can talk about ideas with. You wish you had more, and
> you wish you had better perspective on what there is to learn and how
> best to learn it.

While the [Cognito Mentoring info wiki][CM_wiki] provides excellent
general advice, here I hope to give more specialized advice; in
particular, this page is tailored toward my past self, and documents
advice/"cheat codes"/"redpills" that I wish I had gotten while I was in high school.  Therefore
this page is unlikely to suit most people (since the target audience is
my past self, and I tend to be unusual by most standards).  Another way
to describe this page is to say it is a list of all the things that have
profoundly influenced and inspired me up to this point.  Yet another
description of this page: it's my attempt to counter the farce that is
present-day "liberal arts education" (which aims to help people develop
"critical thinking"); I want to give my own version of a **true liberal
arts education**. As such, you should expect it to take several years to
actually absorb most of the content on this page, if you actually take
advantage of the opportunities (by exploring all the sites I link to, reaching
out to people, going out and actually doing things that are suggested, and so
on).

# School

My thoughts on school as of late 2018:

- I really wish I had tried harder to escape school much earlier. By junior
  high, it was obvious that I hated school and that escaping was better.
  Why didn't I actually quit school? \[insert long list of excuses\]
  Don't make the same mistake!
  If quitting school seems *impossible*, then, well, [*shut up and do the
  impossible*](http://lesswrong.com/lw/up/shut_up_and_do_the_impossible/)!

[Marcus Geduld](https://www.quora.com/What-should-I-do-to-get-over-my-fear-of-public-failure/answer/Marcus-Geduld):

> “\[S\]chool \[...\] is a pathological environment. It's pathological,
> because it sells itself as a  “place of learning” while shunning the
> best learning tool there is \[i.e. failure\].  In school, the worst
> thing you can do is fail. If you fail seriously enough, you get “held
> back” or, at the very least, you get branded with an F. School teaches
> you to loath failing, which is basically teaching you to loath
> learning.”

Some other points:

- Sometimes it's good just to know that you are not the only one who is
  extremely frustrated with high school.  Even conventionally successful
  intellectuals like Noam Chomsky hated high school; see [my answer to the
  Quora question "What would Noam Chomsky think of
  unschooling?"](https://www.quora.com/What-would-Noam-Chomsky-think-of-unschooling/answer/Issa-Rice),
  for instance.

- ["Drawbacks to Formal Education"][drawbacks] by Brian Tomasik

- ["Free the Education
  Market"](http://www.daveshellenberger.com/free-the-education-market) by
  David Shellenberger

- Looking at the resources on [Cognito Mentoring]() is a good idea.

- In general, however, it's probably best to [stay mainstream until you
  have demonstrated success doing unusual stuff][mainstream].

- One can treat the system like a constraint (CM), like a day job (Paul
  Graham), etc.

-   Actively search for alternatives.  For example, if one lives in Washington
    State, then the early entrance programs at UW might be one option. See for
    instance [Alex K. Chen's review][acad] on Quora.

## Paul Graham

Entrepreneur Paul Graham writes good essays on various topics, including
high school.  Even [Vipul Naik](http://vipulnaik.com) of [Cognito
Mentoring]() [highly respects Paul Graham][ob_graham]:

[ob_graham]: http://openborders.info/blog/paul-graham-us-immigration-policy-high-tech-programmers/

The primary essay Graham has on frustration with high school is "[What
You'll Wish You'd Known](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html)" (which
tells students to treat high school like a day job so they can do more
important things outside of school).  His "[Why Nerds are
Unpopular](http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html)" may also be of
interest.^[Related are Bryan Caplan's "[Redistribution: Blocking the Revenge of the Nerds?](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/06/redistribution_1.html)" and [Geoffrey Widdison's answer to Why are people with higher IQ generally not very physically attractive?](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-people-with-higher-IQ-generally-not-very-physically-attractive/answer/Geoffrey-Widdison).]  Below are the parts from "Why Nerds are Unpopular" that most
resonated with me:

> At the time I never tried to separate my wants and weigh them against
> one another. If I had, I would have seen that being smart was more

## Peter Thiel

From "[Peter Thiel: Education = the Catholic Church circa 1500](http://vator.tv/news/2014-11-22-peter-thiel-education-the-catholic-church-circa-1500)" (HT Alex):

> There is something very odd about a society where the most talented
> people all get tracked towards the same elite colleges, where they end
> up studying the same small number of subjects, and going to the same
> small number of careers. And that strikes me as sort of a lack of
> diversity in our thinking about the kinds of things people should be
> doing. That's very limiting for our society as well as for those
> students.

From "[Is Peter Thiel the Martin Luther of Education?](http://vator.tv/news/2014-12-03-is-peter-thiel-the-martin-luther-of-education)" (HT Alex again):

> People thought they could only get saved by going to the Catholic
> church, just like people today believe that salvation involves getting
> a college diploma. And if you don’t  get a college diploma that you're
> going to go to hell.
>
> \[...\]
>
> The reform will come from outside the system and the question people
> always have is, 'What does the next education system look like? What
> will it be?' And I think, like what happened to the Catholic church
> post 1500,  I think there isn't going to be a single new institution
> that will replace it. And this, of course, was the disturbing message
> of the 16th century was, the institution wasn't going to save you. You
> have to figure out how to save yourself. And in a similar way there's
> no education institution that will save you. Young people have to
> figure it out on your own. And that is the last thing anybody wants to
> hear.

And HT Alex again, from "[Peter Thiel -- Conversations with Tyler](https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/peter-thiel-on-the-future-of-innovation-77628a43c0dd)":

> We need to ask, what is it about our society where those of us who do
> not suffer from Asperger’s are at some massive disadvantage because we
> will be talked out of our interesting, original, creative ideas before
> they are even fully formed?

# Rationality community and resources

Since about 2007, there has been a growing community---both online and
offline---based around the idea of "rationality", i.e. the idea that
[one should (1) have beliefs that correspond to reality, and (2) execute
actions in the real world so as to achieve one's goals][rationality].
Learning about rationality is valuable in itself, but there is also an
aspect of being in a "rationalist community" that appeals to many.

[rationality]: http://lesswrong.com/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/

I think the best places to look are: LessWrong, gwern's site, and Slate
Star Codex (a blog by Scott Alexander).  In fact, both gwern and Scott
Alexander are active users of LW who chose to branch off to their own
websites.

In particular, for high school students, 

## LessWrong

It is however important to emphasize that having a good fit with the
community of LW may be important.  For instance, I know several
intelligent people who cannot stand LW.

- find more high school-related posts.

Main page: [LessWrong]().

## gwern

[gwern][gwern_lw] is probably one of the most well-known users on
LessWrong.  He also has a [website][gwern] that has numerous essays on
everything from nootropics to Wikipedia editing.  His notion of [Long
Content][g about] is also especially inspiring: "if one holds onto every
glimmer of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit
like a genius himself".  For high school students especially, the essays
"[On Stress]" and "[On Disrespect]" may be of interest.  His [stories][g
stories] also tend to have "lessons" (like Kafka's parables) and are
entertaining to read.

[gwern_lw]: http://lesswrong.com/user/gwern/
[gwern]: http://www.gwern.net/
[g about]: http://www.gwern.net/About
[on stress]: http://www.gwern.net/On%20Stress
[on disrespect]: http://www.gwern.net/On%20Disrespect
[g stories]: http://www.gwern.net/Notes#stories

I think part of the appeal of gwern is that he inspires many people
because his website doesn't look like "magic"; one can agree that, given
enough time, anyone can attempt what he did.

One thing that gwern does particularly well is emphasizing the
importance of planning for the long term.  For instance he uses free
software, URL archival tools, plain text for his site, etc.


## Slate Star Codex

[Slate Star Codex] is an interesting blog ranging in topics from romance
to social justice to reactionary politics.  See the [top posts][ssc top]
for more.  He is particularly good at [steelmanning] opponents'
arguments.  He is also good at picking out useful content on the
internet, especially from Reddit (displayed on his recurring links
posts).

[Slate Star Codex]: http://slatestarcodex.com/
[ssc top]: http://slatestarcodex.com/top-posts/
[steelmanning]: http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2012/12/the-virtue-of-steelmanning/

The "[graduation speech]" Scott gives may be of interest.  I think it's
entertaining to read, and makes some good points, but ultimately doesn't
do anything new.  (In other words, I think Paul Graham's essays already
provide a lot of the heuristics of the argument; Scott does do a better
job of linking to sources and using numbers though.) I get the feeling
that my views didn't change after reading this, though perhaps for some,
reading the article will give more coherence to their ideas.  The
conclusion is specifically disappointing, since it abruptly ends with
"kindness is what's important".  The essay also doesn't provide much
that is actionable; one is left wondering "Okay, so what do *I* do?" (In
this sense I think Cognito Mentoring does a much better job.)

[graduation speech]: http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/23/ssc-gives-a-graduation-speech/

Scott Alexander also has an older website called [Raikoth], which has
the [The Consequentialism FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20141231113651/http://www.raikoth.net/consequentialism.html).

# Depression

As of late 2018, my basic take on depression:

- While I was depressed, depression sometimes seemed like a pretty interesting
  mental state to be in.  However, now that I have been not depressed for a
  long time, looking back, I see that depression was not an interesting mental
  state after all.  That is to say, you should try to escape the depressed
  state as soon as possible!
- Despite being a "materialist" (in the consciousness sense), I think I didn't
  take materialism seriously enough, and in my day-to-day life, I was still
  implicitly acting like a dualist.  Specifically, I wasn't acting as if things
  like sleep, a good diet, being hydrated, and exercise were important.
- In my case, I think my depression was primarily due to being stuck in school
  and not taking care of myself (see previous bullet point).

---

old version:

High school can be a source of depression, since it is essentially
[child abuse].  Depression can in turn cause other problems.  I'm not
really an expert on the topic, but you can read my page on
[Depression]().

[child abuse]: https://www.quora.com/Do-most-intelligent-people-have-trouble-with-the-public-school-system/answer/Marcus-Geduld

I also do more academic research into depression as an effective
altruism cause on the [Depression page on the Cause Prioritization
Wiki][cp dep].

[cp dep]: http://causeprioritization.org/Depression

See also pages like "[Existential depression in gifted individuals][ex
dep],
which has passages like:

[ex dep]: http://www.davidsongifted.org/db/Articles_id_10269.aspx

> A particular way of breaking through the sense of isolation is through
> touch. In the same way that infants need to be held and touched, so do
> persons who are experiencing existential aloneness. Touch seems to be
> a fundamental and instinctual aspect of existence, as evidenced by
> mother-infant bonding or "failure to thrive" syndrome. Often, I have
> "prescribed" daily hugs for a youngster suffering existential
> depression and have advised parents of reluctant teenagers to say, "I
> know that you may not want a hug, but I need a hug." A hug, a touch on
> the arm, playful jostling, or even a "high five" can be very important
> to such a youngster, because it establishes at least some physical
> connection.

> [...]
>
> It is such existential issues that lead many of our gifted individuals

> only if done in a kind and accepting way. In addition, these
> youngsters will need to understand that existential issues are not
> ones that can be dealt with only once, but rather ones that will need
> frequent revisiting and reconsideration.

Another page, "[Vulnerabilities of highly gifted children][vul gif]",
which has:

[vul gif]: http://www.davidsongifted.org/db/Articles_id_10065.aspx

> It is important to remember that a child with an IQ of 164 is as
> different intellectually from a child with an IQ of 132 as that child

> to learn at the pace of the average child, or even the pace of the
> moderately gifted, is akin to placing an average child in a special
> education classroom and asking that his/her learning rate be slowed
> down to keep pace with the rest of the class. The frustration of
> highly gifted children forced to stifle their love of learning in
> inhospitable environments can result in withdrawal, behavior problems,
> or psychosomatic symptoms.

# Effective altruism

From "[Existential depression in gifted individuals](http://www.davidsongifted.org/db/Articles_id_10269.aspx)":

> Because gifted children are able to consider the possibilities of how
> things might be, they tend to be idealists. However, they are
> simultaneously able to see that the world is falling short of how it
> might be. Because they are intense, gifted children feel keenly the
> disappointment and frustration which occurs when ideals are not
> reached. Similarly, these youngsters quickly spot the inconsistencies,
> arbitrariness and absurdities in society and in the behaviors of those
> around them. Traditions are questioned or challenged. For example, why
> do we put such tight sex-role or age-role restrictions on people? Why
> do people engage in hypocritical behaviors in which they say one thing
> and then do another? Why do people say things they really do not mean
> at all? Why are so many people so unthinking and uncaring in their
> dealings with others? How much difference in the world can one
> person's life make?
>
> [...]
>
> In such depression, gifted children typically try to find some sense
> of meaning, some anchor point which they can grasp to pull themselves
> out of the mire of "unfairness." Often, though, the more they try to
> pull themselves out, the more they become acutely aware that their
> life is finite and brief, that they are alone and are only one very
> small organism in a quite large world, and that there is a frightening
> freedom regarding how one chooses to live one's life. It is at this
> point that they question life's meaning and ask, "Is this all there is
> to life? Is there not ultimate meaning? Does life only have meaning if
> I give it meaning? I am a small, insignificant organism who is alone
> in an absurd, arbitrary and capricious world where my life can have
> little impact, and then I die. Is this all there is?"

In some sense, effective altruism is an answer to the questions "What
should I do with my life?", "Can I do anything meaningful with my
life?", etc.

Although effective altruists claim that effective altruism is [a
question, not an ideology](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/9s/effective_altruism_is_a_question_not_an_ideology/), if you pay enough attention, each
subset of effective altruists clearly has its own agenda.  So you
can't necessarily trust EAs.

I liked this article by Larissa MacFarquhar: "[Extreme altruism: should you care for strangers at the expense of your family?](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/extreme-altruism-should-you-care-for-strangers-as-much-as-family)"


# Online presence and content creation

My main page on this is [Content creation: the organization and
dissemination of knowledge](content-creation).

See also "[Maintaining your online presence][online p]" on the Cognito
Mentoring wiki.

[online p]: http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Maintaining_your_online_presence

I think now that content creation may be one of the best ways to produce
lasting value.  It's always best to think in the long term; practicing a
sport, for instance, may provide short-term satisfaction, but in the
long term (say, after ten years) it is difficult to say what overall
effect the sport had.  (There are obviously creative ways to provide
value even with a sport, e.g. by recording it and therefore providing
entertainment even after one has stopped playing.)

Another point: if you're *extremely unusual* compared to the
mainstream/masses, then chances are, you'll have trouble finding
appropriate peers in real life.  This is why it's important to expand
your search online, and one of the ways to get people's attention online
is by producing great content.

# Thinking about careers

My basic stance on careers as of late 2018:

- If you share my values, then I think not working at a crushing day job is
  important.  Many people complain that they hate their job/complain about
  "bullshit jobs", but then they keep working at such a job.  It seems to me
  that these people either (1) actually secretly like their jobs or buy into
  the protestant work ethic so are on some level fine with wasting their lives
  away, or (2) have competing interests, like earning enough money to buy
  things or impress actual/potential mates.  In the case of (1), I can't really
  help you (you don't share my values). But in the case of (2), I think you
  ought to introspect more and see if these things are really worth it.

# Finding content online

One useful skill to have is identifying useful content online (something that
is not taught in schools).  Here are some places to check out:

- [My guide on reddit](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Using_reddit)
- For maximum transparency, I've released [my Atom/RSS
  subscriptions](https://issarice.com/urls.txt) (with some confidential URLs
  removed) publicly.

# Books

As of late 2018, my basic view on books is that books are pretty useful, and
there are some great books out there, but books tend to be overrated by
intellectualist types (but, strangely, underrated among the people I interact
with most).  I think one ought not weight books more heavily owing to their
length; treat them kind of like blog posts.  To read a book, don't read it
cover to cover; rather, skim it and try to find something interesting in it. If
there is nothing interesting in the book, just toss it.  Unless a book is
really good, if you are reading it cover to cover, you are doing it wrong.

Some books I have enjoyed:

- Dawkins's *Selfish Gene*
- Bryan Caplan's *[Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids](http://deletionpedia.org/en/Selfish_Reasons_to_Have_More_Kids)*
    - See also [an overview](http://lesswrong.com/lw/col/review_selfish_reasons_to_have_more_kids/) on [LessWrong]()
- Gary Drescher's _Good and Real_
- Daniel Dennett's _Consciousness Explained_
- Michael Huemer's _The Problem of Political Authority_

# Extracurriculars

My basic 2018 stance on extracurriculars:

- I think almost all extracurricular activities, especially the common ones
  (sports, practicing an instrument, becoming a club leader), are intrinsically
  (i.e., ignoring signaling benefits) useless in the long run.
- If you feel like you are being left behind by your peers by not doing
  respectable extracurriculars, then try as much as possible to ignore this
  social aspect of your environment.  Ignoring one's social environment is a
  useful skill to learn.
- If one wants to attend an elite college, then doing respectable
  extracurriculars may be worth the cost.

See also "[Chinese loses math face-off to U.S.](http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/05/china/us-defeat-china-math-olympiad/)":

# Doing something important

Richard Hamming's famous talk, "[You and Your Research]" is *very*
inspirational.  There is a [video of the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw), though I think
reading it is better, since I don't particularly like the way he gives
the talk.

[you and your research]: http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html

Some good quotes (emphasis mine):

> In order to get at you individually, I must talk in the first person.
> I have to get you to drop modesty and say to yourself, “**Yes, I would
> like to do first-class work.**” Our society frowns on people who set out
> to do really good work. You're not supposed to; luck is supposed to
> descend on you and you do great things by chance. Well, that's a kind
> of dumb thing to say. I say, **why shouldn't you set out to do something
> significant. You don't have to tell other people, but shouldn't you
> say to yourself, “Yes, I would like to do something significant.”**

Another:

> Another trait, it took me a while to notice. I noticed the following
> facts about people who work with the door open or the door closed. I
> notice that if you have the door to your office closed, you get more
> work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most.
> But 10 years later somehow you don't know quite know what problems are
> worth working on; all the hard work you do is sort of tangential in
> importance. He who works with the door open gets all kinds of
> interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the
> world is and what might be important. Now I cannot prove the cause and
> effect sequence because you might say, “The closed door is symbolic of
> a closed mind.” I don't know. But I can say there is a pretty good
> correlation between those who work with the doors open and those who
> ultimately do important things, although people who work with doors
> closed often work harder. Somehow they seem to work on slightly the
> wrong thing - not much, but enough that they miss fame.

And:

> I started asking, “What are the important problems of your field?” And
> after a week or so, “What important problems are you working on?” And
> after some more time I came in one day and said, “If what you are

[Jeff Meyerson's answer to "How can I overcome the depression from being

particularly good:

# Academia

Beware of the "tunnel vision" of mathematics and physics (and other STEM
fields too), in which people consider these fields to be their "calling"
and won't look into anything else.  In particular, while knowing about
the possibilities of academia is important, *going to graduate school
should not be one's default path*.  As [Holden Karnofsky of GiveWell
says][holden interview], regarding academia, "\[p\]eople usually either
completely ignore that possibility or they completely ignore every other
possibility".  Also you always have to remember [quotes like][phys
drugs] "I have known more people whose lives have been ruined by getting
a Ph.D. in physics than by drugs".  Remember that there also exist
blogs like [100 Reasons NOT to Go to Graduate School][no grad].

school](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Leaving_academia_after_graduate_school)"
and "[Alternatives to
academia](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Alternatives_to_academia)".

A good thing to remember is that *there are already too many people in
academia*.  Academia is insanely crowded, and institutionally you're
very replaceable.  My personal opinion: just stay away from academia
unless you have a *very* good reason.  In particular, if you're neurotic
or mentally unstable *at all*, **just stay away**.  See also Bryan
Caplan's [forthcoming book on education](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/03/table_of_conten.html).  See also one of my absolute

# Computer skills

I've found it pretty useful to know how to use computers well. There are
several aspects to this:

- Programming.  I've found this useful for automating tasks, building websites,
  making money (through contract work), and being able to read/understand
  software that others write.
- Algorithms and data structures.  Beyond basic programming skills, I haven't
  found knowledge of algorithms/data structures to be too useful.  Occasionally
  something may come up where having this knowledge is useful, but the vast
  majority of the time, basic programming skills suffice.  This might change in
  the future if I do work that is more intensive on this front.
- Familiarity with many websites/the internet.
- Unix tools/command line.
- Hardware.  I don't actually know much about computer hardware, and my current
  impression is that I haven't lost out on much by not knowing.

# People

- Here's a list of people you should look into (and read as much of what
  they say as you can stand); bolding indicates people I particularly
  recommend:

    - **Eliezer Yudkowsky**
    - **Wei Dai**
    - **Carl Shulman**
    - Paul Christiano

    - Gary Drescher (*Good and Real*)

      From [MIRI's old recommended courses
      page](https://web.archive.org/web/20140403193242/http://intelligence.org/courses):

      > Good and Real
      >
      > A surprisingly thoughtful book on decision theory and other paradoxes
      > in physics and math that can be dissolved. Reading this book is 100%
      > better than continuing to go through your life with a hazy
      > understanding of how important things like free will, choice, and
      > meaning actually work.

      See also [SIAI Core Reading](https://web.archive.org/web/20111201125142/http://singinst.org:80/reading/corereading/).

    - **Brian Tomasik** (a lot of his philosophy writings are similar in
      content to those of Yudkowsky, Drescher, and Daniel Dennett, but
      Tomasik's writings might be the clearest)
    - Jessica Taylor
    - [Aaron Swartz](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/02/aaron_swartz_he_wanted_to_save_the_world_why_couldn_t_he_save_himself.3.html)
    - Paul Graham
    - **Vipul Naik** (disclosure: I do a lot of [contract work](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Issa+Rice) for Vipul)
    - **Bryan Caplan**: see my page on [EconLog]()
      - Note that I consider Caplan's views on many philosophy topics to be
        wrong. Examples: dualism of the mind, intuitionist ethics, free will.
        I think his posts about applied ethics are good.
        TODO: link to eliezer saying people are better one meta level down in
        ethics.
        TODO: link to hanson and cowen on this.
    - Michael Huemer (mostly _The Problem of Political Authority_)
    - Nick Bostrom
    - Robin Hanson (I think _The Elephant in the Brain_ is probably the best
      introduction. I also like his old papers.)
    - Michael Nielsen
    - Nick Beckstead; in particular, read his PhD thesis, "On the
      Overwhelming Importance of Shaping the Far Future", which you can
      find [here](http://www.nickbeckstead.com/research)
    - Bret Victor; see essays like "[Learnable Programming](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/)" and "[Magic Ink](http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/)".

# Other ideas---expanding your imagination

Alex K. Chen often talks about the important of [expanding your
imagination of what's possible][expand].  Here I'll provide some of my
thoughts on how best to do that, in particular by giving examples of
things that have expanded my imagination.  In general, the best way to
do this is to just *read a lot* of things from a *very diverse set of
places*, and to interact with a lot of people as well.  It really helps
if you have a lot of friends who are into the newest things, because you
can learn a lot about the most exciting things that are happening.

- conventional intellectual heroes like Bertrand Russell, Feynman,

  how to stand up for something, apply critical thinking, etc.  However,

  2000s/2010s, they are somewhat outdated.

- I'm starting to think that colleges really are mostly useless.  In
  particular, if you put in effort to strengthen your online presence
  and find good peers online, then it's *very likely* that the people
  you can talk to online will be *much* better than the people you can
  talk to at your university.  (Though keep in mind potential benefits
  of talking to people in person.) In particular, *don't feel bad if you
  are lonely all the time*.  I tend to take the view that socializing
  with people from whom you will gain little is worse than not
  socializing at all.
- Even if you go to an elite school, are you *really* getting much out
  of the social scene?  Are the things you're learning in class *really*
  useful?

- Another thing (HT Alex again): documenting everything can be really important.
Part of this is to allow yourself to be stalkable (so it can lead to meeting more interesting people, providing value to them, and so forth), but also having access to a lot of the things you've done can remind you of all the *amazing* things you've done.

    Of course, it's very easy [to make fun of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_Take_Pictures_of_Each_Other) people who try to record things instead of "experiencing things", e.g. people who just write about people instead of "going out in the real world", or people who travel but only to take a bunch of photos.
    While this is a valid criticism, I do think that often it's possible to *do both* without much trouble.
    Participating online, for instance, is one way to "naturally" record things as you do them (this is one reason I like content creation so much).

    Also, it can *seem* embarrassing to have a lot of your "stupid" things you do online to last, but consider that *everyone else* also does a lot of stupid things online.
    It might be good to use a pseudonym while young, or to post things in places where it's easily privatable, but my suggestion would be to *never* permanently delete things.
