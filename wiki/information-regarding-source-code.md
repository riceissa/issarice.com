I push changes to GitHub more often than I deploy the site to Linode.
Therefore, clicking on "Website source" or "page source" may or may not reveal the actual source (Markdown) file used to generate the HTML (it may just give you a newer version).
Of course, it's possible to hunt inside the git repository and look for the exact source file, but I figure this is unnecessary except in very exceptional cases.

In the future, I might add the option of linking each deployment with the commit from which it is generated (if this is even possible).
