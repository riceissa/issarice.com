I push changes to GitHub more often than I deploy the site to Linode.
Therefore, clicking on "website source" or "page source" at the top of a page may or may not reveal the actual source (markdown) file used to generate the HTML---it may instead give you a newer version.
Of course, it's possible to hunt inside the git repository and look for the exact source file, but I figure this is unnecessary except in very exceptional cases.

In the future, I might add the option of linking each deployment with the commit from which it is generated.
