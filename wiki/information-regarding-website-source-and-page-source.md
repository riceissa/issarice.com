title: Information regarding website source and page source

*Note: this page is out of date; I will update it when I get a chance.*

I like to be transparent about what I do, so I publish all the source
files used to compile this site. The source code repository on GitHub
can be seen by clicking on "[website source]" on any page.  In addition,
for any page that was written in Pandoc markdown, it's also possible to
click "page source" to view that page's source.  Note that some pages,
such as the [[all pages]] page, are automatically generated during
compilation, so there is no "page source" other than the code that was
used to build the site (along with templates), which can already be
viewed using "website source".

See my [[colophon]] for more information on how this site is built.
