***Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids*** is a book by Bryan Caplan.

# My thoughts after reading the book

My views definitely did shift more toward having kids and having more of
them.  However it isn't clear to me yet whether having kids is better
than, say, paying people to have more kids.  I think it's quite
plausible that mentoring a large number of kids leads to greater impact
than raising a small (in comparison) number of kids.  Of course, there
are things like [sperm
donation](http://www.gwern.net/Ethical%20sperm%20donation), but this
seems quite difficult in the US.

I find Caplan's brand of natalism to be quite appealing, though it's
quite disconcerting to see how he takes everything he says on the topic
to be so obvious.  After reading Nick Beckstead's thesis for example, I
find that even beliefs that might seem obvious might not be so obvious
upon further consideration, and that it's irresponsible to simply say
"[life is too
short](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/12/my_ideal_foil.html)"
to investigate more.

# Quotes

Here are some passages I particularly enjoyed in the book.

On overpopulation, which mentions [keyhole solutions]():


> If the birth of a human being has a lot of positives and a few
> negatives, the constructive response isn’t to denounce “people.” The
> constructive response is to *selectively target* the negatives. Name
> specific problems, and figure out the cheapest way to handle them.
>
> Selective targeting requires more imagination than mass sterilization,
> but it’s worth the extra mental effort. If you want to do something
> about man-made global warming, you don’t have to reduce the number of
> human beings on the planet. You just have to get humanity to reduce
> its carbon emissions. A carbon tax is one simple way to get from here
> to there. To discourage emissions, make emissions more expensive, then
> sit back and watch lifestyles and technology adapt. The same principle
> applies to virtually any population problem you can imagine. Don’t
> like congestion at rush hour? An electronically collected toll is a
> straightforward way to get traffic moving again.

On the limitations of twin and adoption studies:

> For policymakers, the restricted range in twin and adoption studies is
> a major blind spot. But middle-class parents in First World countries
> needn’t worry. Families like yours have been studied to death. In your
> corner of the world, you can safely rely on the postcard version of
> behavioral genetics: The chief cause of family resemblance is
> heredity, not upbringing—and while the short-run effects of upbringing
> are self-evident, they leave little lasting impression.

On trait selection:

> trait selection is better for kids, too. Compatibility is a two-way
> street: When parents get kids they really want, kids get parents who
> really want them. More important, trait selection reassures
> parents—which leads them to be more generous with the gift of life.
> Parents who want this control might seem depraved, but don’t be so
> quick to condemn them. If it’s okay to rig the genetic lottery by
> marrying Mr. Right, why is it wrong to rig the genetic lottery by
> visiting Dr. Know? If it’s okay to refuse to have *any* children, why
> is it wrong to refuse to have children of a certain kind?
