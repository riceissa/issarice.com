A **good entry point** to a website or wiki is a page that is understandable and useful to someone coming from outside the site (e.g. from a search engine or external website).
In other words, a good entry point does not depend on content that is on other pages on the website for comprehension.

I am taking the idea of a good entry point from the [WikiWikiWeb](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FrontPage) [page on "Good Entry Point"](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GoodEntryPoint):

The above sources speak mostly to the importance of having good entry points.
Below, we consider the advantages and disadvantages of trying to make many pages on the site good entry points.

# Advantages

- Doesn't waste time for the reader, who can just get the information they want without going through many other pages
- No forced sequencing
- Leads to higher quality pages, since one must put more effort into making them comprehensibleÂ (?)
- Easier exporting of the site.
In other words, in the future I might want to split up the site by e.g. subject[^split], and having roughly independent pages means I don't have to worry about dependency issues.

[^split]: This might be the case if my website begins to accumulate *a lot* of content.
Right now, even fairly large personal websites (like, say, gwern's) can be processed easily with Hakyll and uploaded as a static site.
On the other hand, Subwiki uses separate MediaWiki instances for its distinct subjects.
One problem is that Git may not be able to handle very large sites, though one could still "chop off" the history after a certain point and begin anew.
I don't imagine this site will ever grow to become something like the size of Wikipedia, so this concern should be rather small, but I do want to make this site *very future-oriented*, since I do want it to last for a *long* time.

# Disadvantages

- Inability to have "sequences" of pages?
- Duplication of content, like introductions?

# On this site

I have tried to make pages good entry points on here.
