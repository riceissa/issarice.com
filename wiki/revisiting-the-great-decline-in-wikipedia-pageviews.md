# Summary

In March 2015 one of us (Vipul Naik) wrote ["The great decline in Wikipedia
pageviews"][great_decline_full] (called "the original post" in this post).
This post is intended as an update to some of the points from that article,
along with some graphs.

# The central puzzle

The central puzzle has not changed much since the original post, but to be
explicit, here are the questions we originally had and hope to answer to some
extent in this post:

  * Have desktop pageviews actually declined?
  * What can explain the observed decline in desktop pageviews?
  * Have overall pageviews declined?
  * Do people subjectively feel they are using Wikipedia less?
    How do we square their subjective impressions with the stats?

# Why is this important?

The [original post][great_decline_full] discusses several motivations for
looking at Wikipedia pageviews.
You can read that post for more details, but to summarize, Wikipedia pageviews
are useful as a way to understand:

  * what people are interested in learning about
  * the overall growth of the internet

We have been interested in this and one of us (Vipul) has written other
articles such as ["How to Understand Your Website Traffic Variation with
Time"][traffic_var_time] on wikiHow.

A more recent motivation for us is the following.
As content creators and more recently as a [funder of content creation
work][cover_summary], one of the appeals of writing articles for Wikipedia is
that they receive more pageviews than if the same articles are hosted on
another site (such as a personal site).
However if Wikipedia's viewership is actually declining, this is something to
consider.

# Overall pageviews vs pageviews of specific pages

Overall pageviews data, i.e. the summed pageviews of all pages within each
combination of language and access type (desktop, mobile), are available
separately from pageviews data of specific pages.
The Wikimedia Foundation publishes some of the pageview statistics for overall
pageviews data in places such as:

  * the ["Wikimedia project at a glance"][at_a_glance] page, which has a plot
    for the total pageviews on the English Wikipedia since 2008 (both of Erik
    Zachte's plots below come from this page)
  * the [Vital Signs dashboard][vital_signs], which is more interactive but
    only has pageviews data starting July 1, 2015
  * the [Wikipedia monthly combined chart][combined_table]

![Page views: 7,948 million per month = 265 million per day = 11.0 million per
hour = 184 thousand per minute = 3.1 thousand per second.
Metrics have been normalized to months of 30 days: Jan\*30/31, Feb\*30/(28|29),
Mar\*30/31, etc.
Plot by Erik Zachte.
Plot is in the public domain.](http://issarice.com/PlotPageviewsEN.png)

Other statistics for various overall growth can be found on the [Wikipedia
Statistics page][wikipedia_statistics], e.g. there is a page on the [size of
Wikipedia][size_of_wp].

![Plot by Erik Zachte. Plot is in the public
domain.](http://issarice.com/PlotTotalArticlesEN.png)

On the other hand, pageviews data for specific pages are available in various
forms:

  * Raw dumps are most consistently available in various datasets such as

      * pagecounts-raw (December 10, 2007 -- August 5, 2016), which only
        includes desktop pageviews and does not allow for identification of
        bots
      * pagecounts-all-sites (September 23, 2014 -- August 5, 2016), which
        includes desktop as well as mobile pageviews but does not allow for
        identification of bots
      * pageviews (starting May 1, 2015), which includes desktop as well as
        mobile pageviews and allows for identification of bots, but only
        recently became available

    However all of these datasets are difficult to manage due to their large
    file sizes.

  * From stats.grok.se, for desktop pageviews from December 10, 2007, through
    December 2015.
  * From the Wikimedia Pageview API starting July 1, 2015.

In other words, the situation is slightly more complicated for per-page
pageviews, and there are fewer ready-made plots available for analysis.
On the other hand, looking at the overall pageviews data has more interference
from new pages being created.
Specific pages that have been around for almost all of the period we look at,
such as pages for colors or countries, don't have this particular form of
interference.
Another benefit of looking at specific pages is that their full revision
history is more manageable.
This means that if, say, a large part of a page was siphoned off to another
page and resulted in fewer pageviews for the original page, this can be
detected.

If we want to look at the mobile pageviews data for specific
pages between September 23, 2014 (when pagecounts-all-sites started) and the
end of June 2015 (after which the Wikimedia Pageview API was launched), the
only thing we can do is to try to process the raw dumps, which we did not do as
it would have given a little more clarity but not all that much more.
The per-page pageviews data from before September 23, 2014 are not available
because [raw server access logs are deleted after about two weeks][delete_log].
We are therefore working with rather limited data.
Nevertheless we still think it's worth looking at the mobile pageviews data
that we *do* have for specific pages because:

  * One thing we wanted to look at is the mobile-to-desktop pageviews ratio of
    various types of pages.
  * There is enough data now from the Wikimedia Pageview API to make the graphs
    interesting to look at.
    (See [§ Shift to mobile](#shift-to-mobile).)

# What has changed since March 2015?

The [original post][great_decline_full]:

> Although the data is available, it’s not currently in an easily computable
> form, and I don’t currently have the time and energy to extract it. I’ll
> update this once the data on all pageviews since September 2014 is available
> on stats.grok.se or a similar platform.

# How we investigated this

Data sources:

  * Wikipedia Views (stats.grok.se and Wikimedia Pageview API).

  * Note on stats.grok.se: stats.grok.se is [just a data visualizer][grok_faq].
    It uses pagecounts-raw, [which][pcr_email]:

    > was maintained by Domas Mituzas originally and taken over by the
    > analytics team.  It was and still is the most used dataset, though it has
    > some \[major\] problems.  It does not count access to the mobile site, it
    > does not filter out spider or bot traffic, and it suffers from unknown
    > loss due to logging infrastructure limitations.

    In other words, stats.grok.se uses an older dataset and [older definition
    of pageview][old_pv_defn] that does not do any bot or spider filtering.

  * Google Trends (for musicians).
    For more on the Google Trends exports, see the [section in the plotting
    documentation][gt_plot_doc]
  * comScore data, WMF overall numbers
  * Google Consumer Surveys and SurveyMonkey Audience

See also the [timeline of Wikimedia analytics][ana] that was created as part of
this process.

# Surveys

As mentioned in the introduction, our two main investigation methods were
plotting pageviews in various ways and conducting several surveys.
This section gives an overview of the surveys and lists the questions for each
survey for reference.
Since both the plots and the surveys were used to test various hypotheses about
the "great decline", the actual discussions about the survey results are
separately embedded in the various discussions about these hypotheses.

Several surveys:

  * A Google Consumer Surveys survey of a US audience (without any demographic
    filters)
    asking people to compare how much their Wikipedia
    usage has changed since 2011.
    This was answered by 1036 people.
    You can see the [results page][gcs_results].
    Note that for this survey, we had to shorten the responses from what they
    were originally due to Google Consumer Surveys' response character limits.
  * A SurveyMonkey US Audience survey (again, no demographic filters) asking
    the same question
    as the Google Consumer Surveys survey, plus some other background and
    follow-up questions.
    We ran this for 50 people and TODO answered.
    After this, we changed the order of the questions to ask about Wikipedia
    first, then about general internet use and use of search engines.
    We ran this second version for 50 people and TODO answered.
  * Vipul's timeline (first version)
  * UW audience (which version?)
  * More audiences?

## Google Consumer Surveys survey

This survey had a single question:

 1. How does your use of Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, compare to your use
    5 years ago (2011)?
      * don't use now; didn't use in 2011
      * use now; didn't use in 2011
      * don't use now; used in 2011
      * use now; used in 2011 (to similar extent)
      * use now; used in 2011 (much more now)
      * use now; used in 2011 (much less now)
      * Other (please specify)

Since this was a Google Consumer Surveys survey, the respondent was also given
the options "Show me a different question" and "Skip survey" below the question
above.

The [survey results][gcs_results] are available.

## SurveyMonkey first survey (internet first)

Note that there is more logic to this survey than a simple list: questions
6 and 7 were only shown if the respondent indicated that their Wikipedia
use changed since 2011 in question 3; if they said more, they were shown
question 6 and if they said less, they were shown question 7 (which was
numbered question 6 for these people).

None of the multiple-choice options were randomized. (TODO: verify.)

A [dummy/mock-up version of the survey][dummy_sm_1] is available.

1.  How does your use of the Internet compare to your use 5 years ago (2011)?
      * don't use now; didn't use in 2011
      * use now; didn't use in 2011
      * don't use now; used in 2011
      * use now; used in 2011 (to similar extent)
      * use now; used in 2011 (much more now)
      * use now; used in 2011 (much less now)
2.  How does your use of search engines (Google search) compare to your
    use 5 years ago (2011)?
      * don't use now; didn't use in 2011
      * use now; didn't use in 2011
      * don't use now; used in 2011
      * use now; used in 2011 (to similar extent)
      * use now; used in 2011 (much more now)
      * use now; used in 2011 (much less now)
3.  How does your use of Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, compare to
    your use 5 years ago (2011)?
      * don't use now; didn't use in 2011
      * use now; didn't use in 2011
      * don't use now; used in 2011
      * use now; used in 2011 (to similar extent)
      * use now; used in 2011 (much more now)
      * use now; used in 2011 (much less now)
4.  Do you have any thoughts on why this is the case for you?
      * Free response
5.  How do you mainly access Wikipedia?
      * Browser on desktop or laptop computer
      * Browser on mobile device
      * A specialized Wikipedia app
6.  You said that you use Wikipedia more now than in 2011. You also gave
    suggestions as to why. Here are some other reasons we've thought about
    that might not have occurred to you. Please select any that apply to you.
      * I didn't even have Internet access back then
      * I go to school now and I didn't before
      * I just use the Internet more
      * I think Wikipedia is more reliable now than it used to be
      * Wikipedia has more relevant content for me now
      * I just select whatever is at the top (or near the top) of search
        engine results, and I guess Wikipedia is showing up more
      * Other (please specify)
7.  You said that you use Wikipedia less now than in 2011. You also gave
    suggestions as to why. Here are some other reasons we've thought about that
    might not have occurred to you. Please select any that apply to you.
      * Google Knowledge cards
      * I use tools like Apple's Siri to access data from Wikipedia without
        reading it directly
      * I just select whatever is at the top (or near the top) of search
        engine results, and I guess Wikipedia is showing up less
      * I'm just generally more knowledgeable so I don't need as much
        encyclopedic information
      * Wikipedia seems to have less relevant content for me; I use other
        websites/wikis more now
      * Wikipedia's quality has decreased so it's not as good now
      * I now think Wikipedia is less reliable as a source of information
      * I'm not in school anymore
      * I use the Internet less in general
      * Other (please specify)

## SurveyMonkey second survey (Wikipedia first)

For this survey, the Wikipedia questions were asked first, and then the
more general internet and search engine questions.
Questions 4 and 5 were only shown when the respondent indicated that they
had changed their Wikipedia use since 2011; if more, the respondent
was shown question 4 and if less they were shown question 5.
All respondents then proceeded to question 6.

None of the multiple-choice options were randomized. (TODO: verify.)

A [dummy/mock-up version of the survey][dummy_sm_2] is available.

1.  How does your use of Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, compare to your
    use 5 years ago (2011)?
      * don't use now; didn't use in 2011
      * use now; didn't use in 2011
      * don't use now; used in 2011
      * use now; used in 2011 (to similar extent)
      * use now; used in 2011 (much more now)
      * use now; used in 2011 (much less now)

# Two leading hypotheses: shift to mobile and non-human traffic

The two biggest ones quantitatively (device switching and bots) are covered in
the graphs, and the others turned out to not be so significant or just
directionally opposite, as we will see later.
the others not directly covered will turn out to be less relevant

## Explanation of the plots used in this section

We plotted the $\log_{10}$ pageviews from December 2007 to August 2016 by
varying each of the following parameters.
All of the plots are [listed in a directory][plots_all].
In addition, all of the code used to generate the plots are in a [GitHub
repository][gh_plots_repo].

Pick one option from each of the following bullet points to arrive at a single
plot.

  * Tag-language combination; 16 in all.
    This is the beginning of the filename.
    Note that we inherit the term "tag" from Wikipedia Views.
    All the tag names can be seen on the ["Multiple tags and
    months"][multi_tag_month_wv] page.
    To see the Wikipedia pages that comprise the tag, click on the tag name,
    then click
    "Submit" to submit a sample query.
    In the resulting page, there is a table with a column called "Tag name";
    click the linked tag name to obtain a table with more columns -- one for
    each Wikipedia page in the tag.
  * Access method and agent: desktop, mobile, desktop + mobile (called
    "total"), desktop + mobile + spiders (called "total\_spider"); 4 in all.
    This comes after the tag-language combination in the filename.
  * All the pages in the tag or just the top 10 and total trend; 2 in all.
    Note that if a tag contains at most 10 pages, the top 10 plot and the plot
    with all the pages will be identical.
    This comes after the access method and agent combination in the filename,
    and is indicated by "top" is it is a top 10 plot and is empty otherwise.
  * Rolling mean (moving average) with window size $n$ months,
    for $n = 1, 3, 6, 12$, where
    $n = 1$ means just the normalized pageview plot; 4 in all.
    This is the last part of the filename besides the extension.
    The rolling mean is intended to smooth out noise, but also makes
    transitions harder to detect.
    For each month, the rolling mean is calculated as follows:
    the pageviews of $n$ months, starting with the current month and going
    backwards in time, are added
    together and then divided by the number of days during this period.
    One consequence of this is that even when $n=1$, the pageviews shown are
    not the raw pageviews for that month, but rather are normalized using the
    number of days in that month.
    It is the $\log_{10}$ of this value that is then taken and plotted.

There are 16 × 4 × 2 × 4 = 512 plots in all.

For example, the file [`americanpundits_total_top_3.png`][pundits_img] would be
the
pageviews for the "American television and radio pundits" tag, for desktop +
mobile (no spiders), with a rolling mean of window size $n = 3$ months, and
only the top 10 pages in the tag.

To visualize the "decline" in pageviews we plotted the pageviews from Wikipedia
Views, which now includes mobile data since July 2015.

In all of the plots, the vertical lines mean the following things:

  * Blue: July 2015, when mobile pageviews were introduced.
    This is only shown in plots with mobile data.
  * Green: $n-1$ months after July 2015, where $n$ is the window size
    of the rolling mean.
    In other words, this marks the *end of the transition* of including mobile
    data; after this line all the months used to calculate the rolling mean
    have mobile pageviews in them.
  * Red: January 2016, when the pageviews data switches from stats.grok.se to
    the Wikimedia Pageview API.
  * Yellow: $n-1$ months after January 2016, where $n$ is the window size of
    the rolling mean.
    In other words, this marks the *end of the transition* of switching to the
    Wikimedia Pageview API; after this line all the months used to calculate
    the rolling mean use only the Wikimedia Pageview API data.

In addition, the horizontal blue line marks the *top quartile for the totals
plot*, i.e. the line above which the top fourth of the data lie.

The trend lines colors for the colors tag *do not* match the colors they
represent.

Example:

![Plot for top 10 musicians, total access](http://ram.issarice.com/~issa/pageview_plots/musicians_total_top_6.png)

Another example:

![Plot for colors in English, desktop, window size of 12 months](http://ram.issarice.com/~issa/pageview_plots/colors_desktop_12.png)

Note that a drop from ~4.3 to ~3.9 on a $\log_{10}$ scale corresponds to a drop
from $10^{4.3} \approx 20{,}000$ to $10^{3.9} \approx 8{,}000$ in terms of
actual pageviews, i.e. a 60% drop.

The plots generally show that desktop pageviews according to stats.grok.se fell
from around 2011 or 2013 (depending on the class of pages examined) to 2015.
Adding on the Wikimedia Pageview API data for desktop from January 2016 to the
present shows that this trend seems to continue, but we think the Pageview API
imposes a stricter filter on bots/spiders.

## Shift to mobile

On the other hand, if we add in the mobile data, we see that predictably there
is a  "bump" starting in July 2015, when the mobile data started; this bump is
more gradual the longer the window size of the rolling mean is.
However, for some classes of pages, even adding in the mobile data -- while
causing the desktop "decline" to become mostly flat -- did not cause the
pageviews to increase back to the level of 2011--2013 pageviews.

The expected bump is
$$\log_{10}(d+m) - \log_{10} d = \log_{10}(1+m/d) = -\log_{10}(1 - m/(m+d))$$

where *d*, *m* are the desktop and mobile pageviews, respectively.

July 2015 -- August 2016.

## Non-human traffic

Vipul: bots usually account for \< 20% of traffic and almost always for \< 40%
of traffic.

We also plotted the same plot with the addition of spiders.
This "addition" only makes sense for the mobile pageviews and the 2016
pageviews for desktop because the pageviews from stats.grok.se already include
bot pageviews (see the ["How we investigated this"](#how-we-investigated-this)
section for more details).
Note that the Wikimedia Pageview API makes the distinction between "bot" and
"spider", but we couldn't find pages for which the "bot" traffic was nonzero,
so we simply excluded the pageviews identified as "bot"; as far as we know,
"spider" means "not human".
We ended up including these spider pageviews from January 2016 for both desktop
and mobile spiders, although it would have also made sense to include the
mobile spiders starting in July 2015.

Here is a classification of the tags we looked at based on whether there was
a rebound to 75th percentile or higher July 2015 or later:

Tag                                   Rebound?
---                                   --------
American pundits                      Yes
Cities                                Yes

US politicians                        Yes
US presidents                         Yes

As can be seen, the colors (in languages besides Spanish) and the sex organs
tag did not have a rebound.
However, this doesn't mean the other tags had increasing traffic; many simply
kept up with the 2011--2013 values.
We think the table above gives a way to tell the tags for which the pageviews
have *definitely* gone down since the 2011--2013 period.

Note also that because the mobile views start in July 2015, adding in the
mobile views gives extra preference to the recent period after this point.
This is because the mobile views from June 30, 2009 (when the mobile site was
launched) until end of June 2015 are not included.
In other words, had these earlier mobile views been included, the total
pageviews in 2011--2013 could have been much higher.
However, we suspect this wouldn't have made a big difference because we think
that mobile use of the web and of Wikipedia has on the whole gone up a lot, so
that it was relatively negligible back in 2011.
For instance, see the [mobile site total pageviews][mob_stats]: for the English
Wikipedia, the mobile site averaged 586 million pageviews per month in 2011,
1,737 million pageviews per month in 2013, and 3,242 million pageviews per
month in 2015, though note that a new pageview definition is used starting May
2015.

Below are two plots to illustrate what a rebound looks like.

![Desktop, mobile, and spiders pageviews for cities, which has a rebound back

![Desktop, mobile, and spiders pageviews for colors, which does not have a
rebound; all of the months with pageviews in the top quartile are in 2013 at

# Other hypotheses

  * Are pageviews even declining?
    It seems that desktop pageviews are declining, but is this still the case
    if we add in mobile views?
    Another difficulty here is that stats.grok.se seems to have used a
    different exclusion method for bots/spiders (evidenced by the stats.grok.se
    pageviews not matching up with the pageviews from the Wikimedia Pageview
    API even on months where they both have data), so it's not totally clear if
    even desktop is declining.

In this section we explore the possible reasons for the observed decline in
desktop pageviews.
Note that the decline is tag-dependent, and we expect some (but not all)
of the reasons to be tag-dependent as well.

  * Shift to mobile → Check by adding the mobile views and by asking people
    on SurveyMonkey
  * People somehow preferring Wikipedia less? → Ask people.
  * Is Wikipedia's popularity in general decreasing? → Can we see that in
    the $\log \mathrm{WV} - \log \mathrm{GT}$ graph?
    Apparently not well.

Other plots:

  * Mobile:desktop ratio vs 95% quantile
  * $\log\mathrm{WV} - \log\mathrm{GT}$

We also found the [peaks for desktop][peak_gist] and [peaks overall][peak_ov]
using different windows.

## Language substitution

  * Language substitution → Check the same tag using different languages
    (we did colors in English, French, and German)

## Indirect access

  * Google Knowledge cards? → Ask people about this in SM survey
  * Siri? → Ask people
  * Could browsers like Opera Mini be adding pageviews as bots?
    See the ["analytics and proxy/remote browsers"][opera] thread on the
    Analytics mailing list.
    Probably not.

## Search engine rankings

  * Wikipedia showing up less in SERPs? → Try to get access to historical
    SERPs for some search queries.
    This actually seems harder to obtain than we first thought.

## Redirects

Could a change in redirects have anything to do with this?
For instance see ["Consider the Redirect"][ctr]:

> Because viewers don't see redirects, viewing a redirect is
> substantively different from viewing a normal page. For example, if a
> user visits the article on "Seattle, Washington", this will be
> recorded as a view to the redirect even though the target article
> "Seattle" is displayed. In this sense, views of redirects will tend
> to be overcounted while views of target articles will tend to be
> undercounted.
>
> [...]
>
> Because redirects are edited infrequently but "viewed" as often as
> millions of times per month each, redirects may be contributing to
> the surprisingly low correlation between edits and views noted by
> Priedhorsky et al. and others.

See also ["Analytics/Data/Redirects -- Wikitech"][redirect_spelling]

Could people somehow be viewing redirects more than the actual pages,
compared to 2011--2013?
To give one recent example (too recent to matter), the Wikipedia
article ["New York"][ny] is about the state, not the city.
However there is a [recent shift][ny_disc] to change all wikilinks
`[[New York]]` to go through the redirect page
["New York (state)"][ny_state], with the wikilink
`[[New York (state)|New York]]`.
This means that less pageviews will be recorded for the New York page,
and more will be recorded for the redirect page.
One idea is that if a sufficiently large number of highly popular pages
have similar sorts of redirection manipulation, the pageviews for the
article itself could be going down even while people are reading the
page more -- the pageview is just being distributed more between the
main article and its redirect pages.

However our impression is that most pageviews come from search engine
results pages, and that wikilinks are not used very much.
See for instance the pageviews on redirects to [Red][red_redirects] and
[Black][black_redirects] (though one complication here is that
redirects might not be static, though in this case we wouldn't expect
the redirects to be changing much).
Likewise there are some effects that should push pageviews *less*
toward redirects.
For instance, presumably Google and other search engines have gotten
better at showing the link to the main article rather than a link to
the redirect page.

## Simple English Wikipedia

Could views be going to the Simple English Wikipedia?
This does not seem to be the case, at least for colors; see the
[tabulation on Wikipedia Views][simple_colors].

## Changes in pageview definition

See also [pageview definition changes][pageview_defn].
We don't think this is a big cause of pageview change.
It's also not clear whether pageview definitions are applied
retroactively.

# Further lines of exploration

This section lists various ideas for other explorations we did a bit of, or
considered doing but ran out of time for.

  * Comparison of Wikipedia pageviews for annual events close to the day of
    those events, and how those numbers have changed over the years (e.g.,
    traffic to the Black Friday page on Black Friday, etc.)
  * Comparison of traffic to the Wikipedia page of a news event relative to
    other objective measures of how "big" it became, to get a sense of the
    importance of Wikipedia in covering breaking news events
  * Weekday/weekend traffic variation on Wikipedia -- has Wikipedia weekday
    traffic changed over time differently than Wikipedia weekend traffic?
    Actually {weekday, weekend} × {desktop, mobile} × {now, earlier} so 2 × 2 ×
    2 = 8 combinations
  * Correlating changes to page size, quality, and editorial activity on pages
    to traffic to that page
