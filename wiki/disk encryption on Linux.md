# Clarifying the terminology

As of Ubuntu 16.10, the default disk encryption method used when selecting
"Encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for security" during installation seems to
be dm-crypt with LUKS.
Here:

* **dm-crypt** is "the standard device-mapper encryption functionality
  provided by the Linux kernel" ([ArchWiki][arch_de]).
* **LUKS** (Linux Unified Key Setup) is "an additional convenience layer which
  stores all of the needed setup information for dm-crypt on the disk itself
  and abstracts partition and key management in an attempt to improve ease of
  use and cryptographic security" ([ArchWiki][arch_de]).
* **cryptsetup** is the actual utility that you run as a user.

The flow of choices (if Ubuntu hadn't chosen everything for you) goes like
this ([ArchWiki][arch_de]):

1. Decide to use block device encryption (rather than, say, stacked filesystem
   encryption).
2. Decide to use dm-crypt (rather than, say, loop-AES or TrueCrypt).
3. Decide to use LUKS (rather than, say, plain dm-crypt mode).

Note that I'm pretty sure LUKS is a
[specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup) so it's
possible to use LUKS *without* using dm-crypt, i.e. you can reverse the order
of (2) and (3) by deciding to use LUKS, and only then deciding on dm-crypt
(rather than some other implementation of LUKS -- I'm not aware of any others).

# Backing up the LUKS header

Check that the device is a LUKS device:

    $ sudo cryptsetup isLuks -v /dev/sda5
    Command successful.

Then [back up the header](https://www.gwern.net/Notes#november-2016-data-loss-postmortem):

    sudo cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup /dev/sda5 \
        --header-backup-file luks-header.bin.crypt
