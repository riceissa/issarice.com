This is a study log of my progress in machine learning.

# Andrew Ng's Coursera course

Began the course on 2017-10-19.

Completed the course on 2017-12-08.

I worked on the course during my after-work hours and on weekends.

The course was easy for me, because I already knew programming. I didn't know any Octave but this wasn't really a problem as the course covers the basics and it is easy enough to look up additional syntax.

The course doesn't cover a lot of the math behind machine learning, which I think is another reason I felt the course was easy.

# After Ng -- reinforcement learning?

After Ng's course, I wasn't sure what to do next. I checked out some resources on reinforcement learning (e.g Sutton & Barto) but found them rather difficult/not explained well so I stopped.

# Understanding more math

I started looking around for more resources on the theory behind machine learning.

On 2017-12-26, I created [Comparison of machine learning textbooks](https://machinelearning.subwiki.org/wiki/Comparison_of_machine_learning_textbooks) because I got frustrated with being unable to keep all the ML books in my head (and the recommendations given in various online discussions).

2017-12-27: I got curious about [probably approximately correct learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probably_approximately_correct_learning) so decided to look through the textbooks on ML that covered that. I found [this post](https://jeremykun.com/2014/01/02/probably-approximately-correct-a-formal-theory-of-learning/) which seems to be better at explaining PAC than any of the textbooks.
