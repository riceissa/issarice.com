This page is about the belief notices (or tags or markers) that are
displayed at the top of pages of this site.  The **belief** or
**epistemic status** of a page efficiently communicates to the reader my
overall confidence in the veracity of the claims made on the page.

In practice, belief notices are most useful when I want to publish
something on here that I find interesting but I'm not especially confident
about.  In other words, it's often a shorthand for something like, "I've
only briefly thought about this topic, and haven't really spent much
effort working on this page, so even though I think it's worth making
public, you shouldn't take this page very seriously, nor should you
assume that I believe the things I'm writing".

More abstractly, publishing content on one's personal site is not just a statement (i.e. the content on the site), but also a *meta-statement*---that one believes in what is said strongly enough to publish them on one's site.
I think this probably tends to 

Of course, there is still a meta-statement even with belief tags; one
can always attempt to pry into the psychology of the writer, e.g.
speculating along the lines of "Well, the fact that they're willing to
make this public---even while marking it as 'unlikely'---still shows
that they're a heretic".  While I recognize that this might be a
problem, I still think belief notices solve most of the initial problem
without being much of a burden.

The "standard" scale of belief that I use is as follows:

- certain
- highly likely
- likely
- possible
- unlikely
- highly unlikely
- remote
- impossible

(I think these are self-explanatory; see the [history](#history) section
for the details.)

In addition to the above possibilities, I also use the following:

fiction
:   For fictional work, which may include work that ironically resembles
non-fictional work.

emotional
:   For rants and other writing that contain strong emotions.  Pages
tagged with this are probably especially epsitemically unreliable.

\[not displayed\]
:   For pages where the notion of "belief" does not make sense (e.g. the
front page of this site). This replaces gwern's and Muflax's "log" (see
[history](#history)).

# History

I took the idea of belief tags from [gwern], who in turn got it from
Muflax.

[gwern]: http://www.gwern.net/

[Muflax explains](http://webcitation.org/6DuYcqyQ3):

> I didn’t want to throw away old texts just because I changed my mind,
> but I also couldn’t let them sit around without an annotation or
> someone might think I still endorsed them.

Here is gwern's [section on belief tags][gw bt]:

> has some structure and conveys a coherent thesis, or it's a
> well-developed draft which could be described as "in progress", and

> reflective writing can be tagged "emotional" ("some cluster of ideas
> that got itself entangled with a complex emotional state, and I needed

> occasionally necessary (similar to fiction)"), and "fiction" needs no

# Frequency

But now, given these belief tags, one might ask what the frequency of
each belief on a site such as this one should be.  Having everything be
"certain" to "likely" might be how a typical site or blog operates; i.e.
the writer only publishes what they believe.  But this sounds
limiting---and this is exactly why belief tags are useful.  But what of
the other extreme?---In other words, what if one were to only write what
one believed to be false?  A successful such execution would display the
writer's creativity, to be sure, but is unlikely to contain much useful
information.

One might also ask what the "natural frequency" of each belief might be,
if a writer were to log *all* of their thoughts\ ...
