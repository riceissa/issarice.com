I have been active on the question-and-answer site [Quora](https://quora.com) since February 2014.
I mostly like trying to ask the most interesting questions; I have asked over 3,000 questions as of August 2015.^[I think question-askers
are often ignored because once a good answer to a question is produced,
the answer is what gets attention, not the question that led to the
answer.]
For my most recent questions, see [my questions page on
Quora][my qs] (note that as of December 2014, this list contains both
the questions I've asked as well as questions I've followed;
unfortunately there isn't a way to see these individually).

[my qs]: https://www.quora.com/Issa-Rice/questions

I also have about 60 answers on the site as of December 2014, which are archived here under [My Quora answers]().

I think Quora has the potential to produce long-lasting content, but [similarly to Vipul Naik, I am uncertain of the social value of contributing](http://vipulnaik.com/quora/)[^vipul].

[^vipul]: Quoting Vipul Naik:

    > The social value of writing questions and answers on Quora remains unclear to me. However, I do intend to write questions and answers on Quora to the extent that it also meets some other goals of mine (such as helping me learn something I want to know, or helping other people learn something specific that I consider important).
