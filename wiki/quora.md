I have been active on the question-and-answer site [Quora](https://quora.com) since February 2014.
My main contribution to the site is in the form of questions (I've asked about 2500 questions as of December 2014).
I also have about 60 answers on the site as of December 2014, which are archived here under [My Quora answers]().

I think Quora has the potential to produce long-lasting content, but [similarly to Vipul Naik, I am uncertain of the social value of contributing](http://vipulnaik.com/quora/)[^vipul].

[^vipul]: Quoting Vipul Naik:

    > The social value of writing questions and answers on Quora remains unclear to me. However, I do intend to write questions and answers on Quora to the extent that it also meets some other goals of mine (such as helping me learn something I want to know, or helping other people learn something specific that I consider important).
