from [some WHO report](http://apps.who.int/nha/database/DocumentationCentre/GetFile/50534721/en):

> The subject of health expenditure is in itself a challenging topic. No exact
> measurement exists for the basic health expenditure in all countries. Even in
> countries with advanced statistical systems, some modifications are made
> periodically to estimated expenditure levels due to improvements in sources
> and methods. In spite of national efforts, not all relevant data are provided
> in the detail needed so estimations are still required. The GHED contains the
> best available estimations/data of the variables to date.

  * Wikipedia's [list of countries by total health expenditure per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita) uses both OECD stats as well as WHO's GHED (but oddly, via the World Bank)
