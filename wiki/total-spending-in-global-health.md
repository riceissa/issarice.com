from [some WHO report](http://apps.who.int/nha/database/DocumentationCentre/GetFile/50534721/en):

> The subject of health expenditure is in itself a challenging topic. No exact
> measurement exists for the basic health expenditure in all countries. Even in
> countries with advanced statistical systems, some modifications are made
> periodically to estimated expenditure levels due to improvements in sources
> and methods. In spite of national efforts, not all relevant data are provided
> in the detail needed so estimations are still required. The GHED contains the
> best available estimations/data of the variables to date.

From [another WHO report](http://apps.who.int/nha/database/DocumentationCentre/GetFile/51106551/en) (page 2):

> In 2011, US$ 6.9 trillion was spent on health. [... by whom? The "Key facts"
> section doesn't say]

From the same report (page 3):

> **Increasing external support** \
> If all donor countries were to immediately honor their overseas development
> assistance pledges, more than three million lives would be saved by 2015.

I'm not sure what these pledges are and how much money they add up to, but
finding that would yield one estimate of the cost per life saved.

  * Wikipedia's [list of countries by total health expenditure per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita) uses both OECD stats as well as WHO's GHED (but oddly, via the World Bank)
  * The Gates Foundation also has a [grants database](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/Quick-Links/Grants-Database) that's a little lacking in some ways, but probably good enough to try to use
  * Individual annual reports put out by various orgs (which ones?)
  * Private donations in the US: [Charity Navigator](http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/content.view/cpid/42) and [NPT](https://www.nptrust.org/philanthropic-resources/charitable-giving-statistics/) give same numbers for 2015.
