This page is about my sleep schedule, i.e. the times of day during which I sleep.

I've tried to get up and go to sleep early, but invariably I tend to stay up late (to 2--4 AM), which forces me to wake up late (10 AM--12 PM) as well.

I sleep anywhere from 5 to 11 hours per night (less sleep during school, since I would be forced to wake up early even if I stayed up late).

At some point I used to regularly nap in the afternoon (and even had a period where I wanted to experiment with polyphasic sleep), but as of June 2016 I rarely nap, and all my sleep is in one continuous block at night.
