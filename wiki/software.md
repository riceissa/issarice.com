This page lists software I use or have used.
This page is a placeholder for now.

- [tmux]()
- [Firefox]() for the most page, occasionally Google Chrome for testing and to
  view pages Firefox has trouble with
- [Vim]() with various plugins for most text editing.
  I also use Emacs or the browser's text box for MediaWiki, since Vim has
  difficulty with long lines.
- [Git]()
- [ELinks]()
- [Exuberant Ctags]()
- Music on Console
- [Newsbeuter]()
- Ubuntu on laptop and Debian on server
- MATE as a desktop environment
- KeePassX
- Zsh for now, but also Bash
- Pandoc
- I use a modified version of Solarized Light as a colorscheme in my terminal.
  By default, Solarized has various shades of gray in its 16-color palette,
  which makes some console programs difficult to use; I therefore replace those
  colors with the equivalents from Tango.
  You can see the [resulting values][colors].
- IPython
- htop.
- Terminator.
  No strong preference for the most part, except that I dislike it when the
  terminal emulator intercepts Alt key mappings, like `Alt`-`f`.
- Virtualbox
- PDF.js or Atril for most PDF files.
  PDF.js sometimes has trouble copying text, so I occasionally have to reopen a
  PDF in Atril, but otherwise I don't have a strong preference for one or the
  other.
- Still looking for a good epub reader.

Programs in trial mode:

- fzf
- ag
- mupdf
