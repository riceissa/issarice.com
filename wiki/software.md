This page lists software I use or have used.
This page is a placeholder for now.

- [tmux]()
- [Firefox]() for the vast majority of daily browsing; I also use Google Chrome
  for Facebook and Gmail, and occasionally for some other JavaScript-heavy sites
  that I don't want to view with Firefox.
  For most JavaScript-heavy web apps, often the easiest way to use them is to
  run them under an incognito Chrome window, rather than manually enabling a
  bunch of domains on NoScript or uMatrix.
- [Vim]() with various plugins for most text editing.
- [Git]()
- Anki for spaced repetition
- [ELinks](), Links, or Lynx for lightweight browsing depending on what I want.
  ELinks has tabbed browsing which I find easy to use, but Links can show
  images with the `-g` flag. Lynx seems to do correct checking for SSL certificates and
  additionally has `-localhost -dump` that is suitable for producing plain text
  dumps of webpages.
- [Exuberant Ctags]()
- [Music On Console]()
- [Newsbeuter]() (actually called Newsboat now)
- Ubuntu on laptop, and Ubuntu and Debian on server
- MATE as a desktop environment
- KeePassX
- Bash for my shell
- Pandoc
- I use a modified version of Solarized Light as a colorscheme in my terminal.
  By default, Solarized has various shades of gray in its 16-color palette,
  which makes some console programs difficult to use; I therefore replace those
  colors with the equivalents from Tango.
  You can see the [resulting values][colors].
- IPython (now called Jupyter Qt console)
- rxvt-unicode a.k.a. urxvt
  No strong preference for the most part, except that I dislike it when the
  terminal emulator intercepts Alt key mappings, like `Alt`-`f`.
- PDF.js or Atril for most PDF files.
  For short PDFs, PDF.js suffices, but for longer PDFs I usually download a
  copy and read them on Atril.
- Still looking for a good epub reader.
  I currently use FBReader but find the scrolling mechanism annoying.
- `youtube-dl`
- GNU userland, mainly because that's what comes with Debian and Ubuntu and
  is what I'm most used to.
  I also install moreutils for `sponge`.
- [rsync](rsync)
- I often use `less` (e.g. instead of `tail -f` I use `less +F`)
- fzf, mostly for recalling commands in bash with CTRL-R.
- [Emacs](emacs) org mode
- Zim Wiki for a local private wiki
- Python3 as a desktop calculator
- ag
