This page lists software I use or have used.
This page is a placeholder for now.

- [tmux]()
- [Firefox]() for the most part, occasionally Google Chrome for testing and to
  view pages Firefox has trouble with
- [Vim]() with various plugins for most text editing.
  I also use [Emacs]() or the browser's text box for MediaWiki, since Vim has
  difficulty with long lines.
- [Git]()
- [ELinks](), Links, or Lynx for lightweight browsing depending on what I want.
  ELinks has tabbed browsing which I find easy to use, but Links can show
  images with `-g`. Lynx seems to do correct checking for SSL certificates and
  additionally has `-localhost -dump` that is suitable for producing plain text
  dumps of webpages.
- [Exuberant Ctags]()
- [Music On Console]()
- [Newsbeuter]()
- Ubuntu on laptop and Debian on server
- MATE as a desktop environment
- KeePassX
- Bash for my shell
- Pandoc
- [mutt]() for sending mail sometimes
- I use a modified version of Solarized Light as a colorscheme in my terminal.
  By default, Solarized has various shades of gray in its 16-color palette,
  which makes some console programs difficult to use; I therefore replace those
  colors with the equivalents from Tango.
  You can see the [resulting values][colors].
- IPython
- htop.
- urxvt.
  No strong preference for the most part, except that I dislike it when the
  terminal emulator intercepts Alt key mappings, like `Alt`-`f`.
- Virtualbox
- PDF.js or Atril for most PDF files.
  PDF.js sometimes has trouble copying text, so I occasionally have to reopen a
  PDF in Atril, but otherwise I don't have a strong preference for one or the
  other.
- Still looking for a good epub reader.
- `youtube-dl`
- GNU userland, mainly because that's what comes with Debian and Ubuntu and
  what I'm most used to.
  I also install moreutils for `sponge`.
- LibreOffice Calc for converting between CSV and XLS.
  I know almost nothing about it, but it seems to do what I want.
- I often use `less` (e.g. instead of `tail -f` I use `less +F`)
- fzf

Programs in trial mode:

- ag
- mupdf
- `mpsyt`
- arbtt
- Emacs org mode
