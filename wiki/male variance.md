Just some links for now:

- "[Is There Anything Good About Men?](https://web.archive.org/web/20171108110150/http://www.denisdutton.com/baumeister.htm)" by Roy Baumeister.
I'd be *very* interested in reading feminist responses to this, but so far I haven't been able to find any good ones.

- Here's [Caplan](econlog): "[Male Variance and the Remnants of the Gender Gap](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/08/male_variance_a.html)"
