Each repository on GitHub has a punch card graph under `/graphs/punch-card`.
This page looks at the punch card graphs of some projects.

Note that contribution graphs on GitHub are [only timezone-aware after
2014-03-10](https://github.com/blog/1793-timezone-aware-contribution-graphs):

> When counting commits, we use the timezone information present in the
> timestamps for those commits. Pull requests and issues opened on the web will
> use the timezone of your browser. If you use the API you can also specify
> your timezone.

> We don't want to mess up your current contribution streaks, so only
> contributions after Monday 10 March 2014 (Temps Universel CoordonnÃ©) will be
> timezone-aware.

So for projects with the bulk of commits in the past, it would be better to
filter out the older commits.
However, even for older projects a weekday/weekend split should be observable.
