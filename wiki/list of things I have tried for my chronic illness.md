some overly specific tips that may help you if you have a chronic illness similar to mine. at the time of writing i don't have any official diagnosis for my condition (other than testing positive on SIBO breath tests, testing positive on a bunch of environmental and food allergies, ), but i suspect it's some combination of MCAS, Sjogren's syndrome, POTS, SIBO, and maybe more.

note: i moved this to a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n5ztTZ0gsqsOnZAjknwY6Sgeq8jkpE58GPBdypTJ6Mk/edit?usp=sharing), still working on it. will make it publicly accessible once it's more ready.
