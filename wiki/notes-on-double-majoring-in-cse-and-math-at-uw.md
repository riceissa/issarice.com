Note: the information on this page is highly specific to my own situation, and is unlikely to apply to you.
Specifically, it captures information about the combination of double-majoring in computer science and (BS standard) mathematics at University of Washington *and* taking both of the yearlong honors calculus sequences (math 13X and math 33X).

Basic facts:

- On the math 13X description, we find:

    > Covers the material of MATH 124, MATH 125, MATH 126; MATH 307, MATH 308.

    On the math 33X description, we find:

    > Students who complete this sequence are not required to take MATH 300, MATH 309, MATH 324, MATH 327, MATH 328, and MATH 427.

    Both of these are from [the math course catalog](https://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/math.html).

    Looking at the [BS math standard option graduation requirements](https://web.archive.org/web/20151012134732/https://www.math.washington.edu/Undergrad/Handbook/BS_STAND_SPR2015.pdf), we see that all of the courses under both "Application Requirements" and under the top portion of "Mathematics Requirements" are covered by the courses math 13X--33X cover.
    In addition, math 13X has math 307, and math 33X has math 309 and 427.
    This would make it seem like the seven course requirement is cut down to just four.
    The electives add another five, but this is cut down to three by using courses from other departments (in my case, CSE).
    This *should* mean a total of seven math courses after math 336, but I confirmed with a math advisor that I in fact only need to take six more math courses (I'm not exactly sure where this comes from).
