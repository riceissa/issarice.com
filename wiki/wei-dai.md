Something I find unfortunate is the apparent lack of enthusiasm for Wei Dai and his online content in the [effective altruism]() community. His [posts](http://lesswrong.com/user/Wei_Dai/submitted/) and [comments](http://lesswrong.com/user/Wei_Dai/comments/) on LessWrong seem to me to be clear, important, and relevant to effective altruism.
