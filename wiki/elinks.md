On some shells, ELinks does not recover properly after suspending the process
with `Ctrl-z`.
An [email in a relevant thread][email] gives the suggestion to suspend again
with `Ctrl-z`, and then to bring ELinks back right away with `fg`.

ELinks doesn't seem to detect self-signed SSL certificates, unlike lynx,
links2, w3m, etc.

TODO: talk about Vim keybindings.
