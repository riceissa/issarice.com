Here are the tools used to build and run this site.

Most pages are written using [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) using the [Pandoc markdown syntax](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown).
The markdown files are then compiled to HTML using Pandoc and a Makefile.

The [style sheet for this
site](https://github.com/riceissa/issarice.com/blob/master/css/solarized_light.css) is
influenced by aspects of various other sites, including
[gitit](https://web.archive.org/web/20150330005917/http://gitit.johnmacfarlane.net:80/),
[Gwern’s site](http://www.gwern.net/About#tools), GitHub’s (old) documentation
pages, and [Butterick's book on typography](http://practicaltypography.com/).

The colors for the "light" and "dark" themes (available when changing the
"color" from the top menu -- available only when JavaScript is enabled) mostly
come from Ethan Schoonover's [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).

All of the source files necessary to build this site are hosted on GitHub.
You can [visit the repository](https://github.com/riceissa/issarice.com) on GitHub.
I also have a mirror on [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/riceissa/issarice.com/)
and on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/riceissa/issarice.com).

The actual site is served via [Linode](https://www.linode.com/), using Nginx on a 64-bit Debian 9 (Stretch) machine.
I currently use the [Linode 2GB \$10 per month plan](https://www.linode.com/pricing).

I have registered the domains [issarice.com](http://issarice.com) and [riceissa.com](http://riceissa.com) through [Hover](https://www.hover.com/).
