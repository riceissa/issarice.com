Effort can be rated on the following scale. In each case I assume I am the one
performing the task (skill-sets vary considerably across people so it would be difficult to provide a good estimate for the general population). I have a good programming and writing ability but I am not
exceptional by any means and I expect many people can perform at a comparable
level or even better depending on their expertise. (As a side note, even on the
project idea generation front I don't think I am exceptional -- in fact this
page so far is quite rudimentary and biased toward things I find personally
interesting rather than most useful to the world -- so I think other people can
and should also be more transparent about projects they want to see.) Days here
refer to work days, so 8 hour periods. Of course, [planning fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy "“Planning fallacy”. English Wikipedia. Retrieved November 26, 2017.") makes it difficult to estimate how long a project will take,
but I list some things I have actually produced in the past to ground myself on
the kinds of tasks and their timescales.

0
:   Up to one day (8 hours) of effort. These are relatively quick things that can be
done. Examples are [Timeline of Carl Shulman publications](https://timelines.issarice.com/index.php?title=Timeline_of_Carl_Shulman_publications&oldid=15618) as of July 13, 2017 (about 7 hours of work) and some
global health pages like Amanda Glassman (I think).

1
:   More than one day and up to two weeks (8--80 hours) of effort. Examples on this level are
[timeline of MIRI](https://timelines.issarice.com/index.php?title=Timeline_of_Machine_Intelligence_Research_Institute&oldid=15715) as of July 15, 2017 (75 hours) at the upper end. I think [timeline of AMF](https://timelines.issarice.com/index.php?title=Timeline_of_Against_Malaria_Foundation&oldid=13553) (33 hours) around the middle.

2
:   More than two weeks (80 hours) of effort. Examples here are my total work so far on
the [donations list site](https://donations.vipulnaik.com/) (as of November 2017) and my total work on [Devec wiki](https://devec.subwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page) (as of November 2017).

This is not an exhaustive list of project ideas. In particular if I have
already done some work on a project and just want to make general improvements
to it, I won't usually list it here (*all* projects can be improved to varying
extents, and it would be tedious to list them all). If I have specific
improvements, I will try to list them here.

|Project|Description|Effort|Venue|Format|
|----------------|------------------------------------|-----:|--------|--------|
|Various contributions to [Cause Prioritization Wiki](https://causeprioritization.org/)|The wiki has been mostly dormant for a few years, and at some point I would like to return to writing more pages for it. I might list some specific area for improvement in this list at some point|2|Cause Prioritization Wiki|Various|
|Simple Vim autocompletion for Python|I would like a simple smart autocompletion plugin. What I mean by this is that when I type `<C-X><C-O>` it should use the plugin's autocompletion instead of omnicompletion. That is all I want the plugin to do, i.e. I don't want it to override other keybindings, take over `<C-U>`, complete as I type, do error scanning, etc. I think [jedi-vim](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim) comes close and maybe I just need to figure out the right configuration for that.|1|GitHub|Code|
