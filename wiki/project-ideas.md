|Various contributions to [Cause Prioritization Wiki](https://causeprioritization.org/)|The wiki has been mostly dormant for a few years, and at some point I would like to return to writing more pages for it. I might list some specific area for improvement in this list at some point|2|Cause Prioritization Wiki|Various|
|Simple Vim autocompletion for Python|I would like a simple smart autocompletion plugin. What I mean by this is that when I type `<C-X><C-O>` it should use the plugin's autocompletion instead of omnicompletion. That is all I want the plugin to do, i.e. I don't want it to override other keybindings, take over `<C-U>`, complete as I type, do error scanning, etc. I think [jedi-vim](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim) comes close and maybe I just need to figure out the right configuration for that.|1|GitHub|Code|
