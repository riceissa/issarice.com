I am writing this page for various reasons. Some of these are to:

* Give people a better idea of what I might work on next. I like to make myself
  predictable so others can plan according to a good model of how I will act.
* Tell the world the things I want to see. I think the things in this list are
  useful to the world, and it doesn't need to be me who does it. It would be
  great to find out that somebody saw a sufficient need based partly on this
  page and decided to make something. Similar to request for startups or
  charities.
* Track the things I want to work on. I often think of things while daydreaming
  or working on something else. If I don't put an effort into recording things
  to work on (and training myself to notice needs that exist in the world), I
  might forget.
* Clean out some tasks from orgmode. I have a backlog of tasks in orgmode. A
  lot of these aren't for me to immediately work on, and they kind of clutter
  up my orgmode file.
* Give potential funders an idea of what they can fund. If I already want to
  see something in the world, a modest amount of funding can shift my
  priorities to work on that thing.
* Find potential collaborators. Especially for the larger projects, it can be
  helpful to have other interested parties on board to divide up the work.
* Give people a better idea of where I'm coming from. This is a broader point
  that applies to other efforts I have made to be more transparent.

Parameters: idea, description, effort, venue (Wikipedia, blog post on LW,
standalone site, etc), format (code, prose, data, etc). These parameters exist
to be helpful in scanning the list and orientation oneself, but are only
suggestive; it is often the case that as a project proceeds, details become
cleaner or change.

Effort can be rated on the following scale. In each case I assume I am the one
performing the task. I have a good programming and writing ability but I am not
exceptional by any means and I expect many people can perform at a comparable
level or even better depending on their expertise. (As a side note, even on the
project idea generation front I don't think I am exceptional -- in fact this
page so far is quite rudimentary and biased toward things I find personally
interesting rather than most useful to the world -- so I think other people can
and should also be more transparent about projects they want to see.) Days here
refer to work days, so 8 hour periods. Of course, planning fallacy blah blah,
so I list some things I have actually produced in the past to ground myself on
the kinds of tasks and their timescales.

0
:   Up to one day of effort. These are relatively quick things that can be
done. Examples are first round of timeline of Carl Shulman publications, some
global health pages like Amanda Glassman (I think)

1
:   More than one day and up to two weeks of effort. Examples on this level are
timeline of MIRI at the upper end. I think timeline of AMF at the lower end but
will have to check.

2
:   More than two weeks of effort. Examples here are my total work so far on
the donations list site (I think), my total work on Devec wiki.

|Project|Description|Effort|Venue|Format|
|----------------|------------------------------------|------|--------|--------|
|Pandoc scripting guide|A guide to scripting with Pandoc. Probably with Lua filters now that Pandoc 2.0 is out. It would be good to cover common frustrations like how to debug your filter, some common real-life filters, and so on.|1||Prose with code samples|
|Naturalism table|A table summarizing naturalistic worldviews. The columns can be "author", "view on consciousness", "view on free will", "view on time", etc. In other words, the "[mysterious questions](http://lesswrong.com/lw/iu/mysterious_answers_to_mysterious_questions/ "Eliezer Yudkowsky. “Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions”. LessWrong. August 25, 2007. Retrieved November 20, 2017.")". The authors that I would like to be covered are Yudkowsky, Tomasik, Gary Drescher, and Dennett. The cells of the table can contain the works by the author that discusses the views.||||
