I use the text editor GNU Emacs for various tasks that my main text editor,
[Vim](wiki/vim.md), does not handle well.

As I have written [elsewhere](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Working_with_long_lines?useskin=monobook),
Vim does a poor job of handling files with long lines.
When programming or writing prose under my control, this is not a problem:
the programming languages I tend to use have ways of forcing a linebreak, and
markup languages like Markdown and LaTeX allow single linebreaks within
paragraphs.

However, I still manage to encounter some files with long lines, most prominently
when editing the English Wikipedia, where it is standard for paragraphs to consist
of a single long line.
For simple edits, just using the browser's text field is fine, but for more involved
editing tasks I've found it useful to use Emacs.
With a bit of practice, Emacs becomes much more efficient than the standard CUA
keybings will allow.

I consider myself an Emacs novice.
