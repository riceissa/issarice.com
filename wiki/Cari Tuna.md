# Who is Cari Tuna anyway?

- Cari Tuna is in charge (?) of Good Ventures, which is planning to give away most of Dustin Moskovitz's wealth in his lifetime.
But do we know much about her?

- [articles from Yale Daily](http://yaledailynews.com/blog/author/carituna/page/2/); [search query](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=cari%20tuna%20%22Yale%20Daily%20News%22)

- [They made a fortune in Silicon Valley\. Now they’re giving most of it away\.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/billionaire-couple-give-plenty-to-charity-but-they-do-quite-a-bit-of-homework/2014/12/26/19fae34c-86d6-11e4-b9b7-b8632ae73d25_story.html):

    > “I knew he was a co-founder of Facebook and I used Facebook,” she said, “but I had just moved out to San Francisco and wasn’t really all that familiar with the tech world. It was pretty shocking.”

    > Here's what we know: Cari Tuna graduated from Yale University, where she wrote for the Yale Daily News. She went straight from Yale to the Wall Street Journal, where she covered Silicon Valley and the tech industry for nearly three years. There she met Moskovitz. In 2011, she quit journalism to focus full time on philanthropy and is now president of Good Ventures, the foundation through which she and Moskovitz will give away his billions.

- There is an apparent contradiction here, which is partly resolved by constructing a timeline of her (see her [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cari-tuna-3238898): Reporter, The Wall Street Journal, June 2008 – April 2011 (2 years 11 months) San Francisco Bay Area), and partly by noting that [her WSJ articles](http://topics.wsj.com/person/T/cari-tuna/6189) don't seem to be about "Silicon Valley and the tech industry".

- From ["Meet the Tech Billionaires Trying to Swing Today's Elections"](http://valleywag.gawker.com/meet-the-tech-billionaires-trying-to-swing-todays-elect-1654704395):

she donated **\$2,600** to Sean Eldridge's congressional campaign.
Eldridge, like Tuna, is married to a Facebook co-founder.
