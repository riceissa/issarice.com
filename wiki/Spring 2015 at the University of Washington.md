# Courses

Here are the courses I took for autumn 2014 at UW:

- [[ATM S 559]]
- [[MATH 136]]
- [[ENGL 478]]
- [[PHYS 121]]

# Review

This was the first (and so far, as of winter 2016, only) quarter in which I took 18 credits (I took 17 and 16 credits, respectively, in autumn and winter quarters).
For this reason, and also because I took ATM S 559, a graduate-level class, I found this quarter to be rather difficult and stressful.
