The concept of a **keyhole solution** is one that is generally useful and seems like it should be more broadly known, but isn't (perhaps because it is often used without being given a name).

As [the *Open Borders: The Case* page on keyhole solutions](http://openborders.info/keyhole-solutions/) explains:

> The term “keyhole solutions” is used for the radical idea of targeting
> specific problems through narrow, targeted solutions rather than
> trying to restrict or control unrelated activity. In the context of
> migration, they involve taxing or restricting specific problematic
> migrant activities rather than a blanket denial of migration.

In some sense, a keyhole solution gives one an "excuse" to do something that is be opposed by taking away at least some of its drawbacks.
From this general framework, one can come up with several other related concepts:

- Coming up with "excuses" to not do something by achieving its benefits by alternative means

These can be represented in a grid:

| | pro-action | anti-action |
|-|:-----------|:------------|
| **act on benefits** | a| finding more efficient solutions by asking "Can I get the benefits some other way?"|
| **act on drawbacks** | keyhole solutions |d|

From Bryan Caplan's *Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids*:
