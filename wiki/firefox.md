As of March 2017, Firefox is the main web browser I use.
I find it slower than Google Chrome (which I use for
[Facebook](facebook), Gmail, and /g/), but find its address bar and some
plugins more useful.

# Extensions

- Decentraleyes
- DOM Inspector
- HTTPS Everywhere
- It's All Text!
- NoScript
- Privacy Badger
- ScrapBook X
- uBlock Origin
- Ubuntu Modifications (came with Ubuntu)
- VimFx
- Web Developer (for viewing the generated HTML source)
- Zotero

Due to a recent Firefox upgrade, many of the plugins are now marked as
"Legacy".
