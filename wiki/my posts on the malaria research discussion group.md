As part of my exploration of malaria, I stumbled onto collection methods of
mosquitoes. I find it interesting that there are numerous methods of mosquito
collection. Human-landing catch (where human collectors expose their limbs to
catch the mosquitoes that land) seems to be the gold standard, but there are
also various elaborate trapping methods. This paper has illustrations of
several:

Coverage on Wikipedia seems to be quite poor. Currently I'm working on the page
for human-landing catch:

Thoughts?
