Writing these notes on my website ... it's an odd feeling. because of
the different metalevel message it gives off. it says "im bothering to
write this up so everyone in the world can read it", which you can't
give off if you simply write things in your personal diary.  this is
something i still struggle with. but i *do* think that there are people
out there who can sympathize with what i write, enough of them or to
enough of a degree, that writing them and making them public can be
worthwhile. there is of course some other considerations, like whether
people could use what i write here against me, and whatnot.
