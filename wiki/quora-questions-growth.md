This page tracks the growth of the number of questions on Quora. We use the number of pages in the sitemap to estimate the number of questions. This metric will be inaccurate if the sitemap only covers some portion of questions and this portion changes over time.

# Table

In the table below, I include the number of questions by Alex K. Chen (AKC) because as far as I know, he has asked the most questions on the site. I include the number of questions I have asked because I am curious about tracking my own activity (not because I consider my question-asking particularly notable).

# History

On June 17, 2014, I added the Quora question ["What is the order of the questions on the Quora sitemap?"](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-order-of-the-questions-on-the-Quora-sitemap/log "“Change Log - What is the order of the questions on the Quora sitemap?”. Quora. Retrieved November 26, 2017.") In the question details, I began recording the number of pages that appeared in the sitemap, to estimate the number of total questions on Quora.
