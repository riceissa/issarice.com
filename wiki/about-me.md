# Self-introduction

I am highly introverted[^mbti] and curious about a wide array of things,
including [effective altruism]() and rationality (mostly [LessWrong]()).
Currently I am working mainly on the [Cause Prioritization Wiki][cp].

[cp]: http://causeprioritization.org/

[^mbti]: In case you're curious, I am an INTP on the [Myers–Briggs Type
Indicator](!w).  The MBTI is often mocked as “unscientific”, but I think
it can be quite useful; see “[On Types of Typologies]” for more.

[On Types of Typologies]: http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/27/on-types-of-typologies/

I like spending time on the question-and-answer site [Quora]() mostly by
trying to ask the most interesting questions.  I think question-askers
are often ignored because once a good answer to a question is produced,
the answer is what gets attention, not the question that led to the
answer.  For my most recent questions, see [my questions page on
Quora][my qs] (note that as of December 2014, this list contains both
the questions I've asked as well as questions I've followed;
unfortunately there isn't a way to see these individually).

I’m also highly interested in the quantified self movement,
vegetarianism and veganism, the free content movement (so things like
copyleft and the [Creative Commons](!w)), the free software movement,
typography (though mostly just with LaTeX and this website), pure math
(formal logic and set theory, though my knowledge here is not very
advanced at this point), the [organization and dissemination of
knowledge](content-creation), longevity, neoteny and looking young,
[castration and eunuchs](http://lesswrong.com/lw/lm4/effects_of_castration_on_the_life_expectancy_of/), pederasty, long-term thinking, [Econlog](), and
[existential risk].

I am also passionate about the unschooling movement (see the Quora topic
[Education Reform and Disruption] and [my answer][chomsky usch] to “What
would Noam Chomsky think of unschooling?” on Quora for more), and
occasionally contribute to the Cognito Mentoring info wiki (a resource
designed to help students who are intellectually curious but are
frustrated with traditional schooling); you can view [my
contributions][cm cont].

Ambivalence about Japan is also an important part of me[^japan]; see
Nobel laureate [Ōe Kenzaburō’s speech][oe speech] on the topic.  I do
like the language and some of its literature and [music](!w Fishmans), and am fascinated by certain
aspects of Japanese society (like [hikikomori](!w) and the [decline in
traditional romantic relationships][japan sex]), but cannot stand for
instance its emphasis on deference to authority, nor can I tolerate its
education system.

[^japan]: I lived in Japan for six years.  You can find some locations
[here](https://www.quora.com/Issa-Rice/about).

I am also currently a second-year student at University of Washington
(UW) in Seattle, WA, USA.  My major is computer science, but
I’m also highly interested in mathematics.  I am continually
conscious that the most important work I can do may not yet exist as a
career; as such I want to adopt “a more wary attitude where I try, at
each stage, to equip myself best for the present and the immediate
future while gathering knowledge and resources that will help me in the
farther future” ([source][vipul future]).  At the moment I think
computer science is the best option for me in terms of being versatile
for the future.
