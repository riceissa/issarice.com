- heart rate/HRV
- Control Pause, kind of
- O2 saturation
- one foot balance seconds
- ambient temperature at which distress is reported -- still pretty subjective
- scores on games like chess or 2048?
- ability to do mental arithmetic? A lot of my symptoms, when bad enough, impair my cognition. The thing is, as I practice I will naturally improve my ability.
- blood glucose/blood tests in general (but most tests need to be scheduled/ordered by a doctor)
- Number of seconds to swallow (for a fixed food/amount)
- body weight

going by symptoms:

breathing:

- spirometry
- N/AS/AF scheme that I came up with is kind of there

Hunger attack: ???

Anxiety: ???

Heat sensitivity:

- sweat volume?

Gut:

- stool frequency, color, size, texture, float vs sink, clear vs murky water, etc.
