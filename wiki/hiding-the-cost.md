This page describes the tendency of people to list the *benefits* they derive
from something without similarly listing the *cost* of that same thing.

Examples:

-   People describing in detail all of the things they get from attending EA
    Global without saying how much it cost them (for the ticket, flight, hotel
    fees, disruption in workflow, etc.).
-   Something I've noticed while doing my [dive into global health][gh]: people
    tend to enthusiastically list all of the impact their program has had,
    without listing how much the program cost. For instance, look at how empty
    the ["Operating costs/funding level (in US$)" column][psigh costs] is on my
    "Priority-setting in global health" draft page (some of it is due to the
    page being incomplete, but much of it is because the information could not
    be found in a reasonable amount of time). While this is something one can
    expect without doing any look into global health, it's important to realize
    the prevalence of this tendency, and also to experience how frustrating it
    is that this sort of information cannot be found.

    Perhaps another way to say this is that there is a *social norm that makes
    it okay to not list the cost of a health program*. If there was a social
    norm of pestering program managers to release cost information, and to not
    take seriously anyone who hides this sort of information, we could expect
    this information to be widely available.
