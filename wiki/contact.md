The best way to contact me is via email at [riceissa@gmail.com][email].
You can use my [PGP public key][pgp] if you would like to encrypt your message.

If you prefer, you can friend me on [Facebook]() and message me there.

You can also [send me anonymous feedback][feedback] (an idea I got from [Luke
Muehlhauser][l_feedb] and [Gwern][g_feedb]).

I try to respond to everyone who contacts me, but [for various reasons][noc] I
might not; feel free to [ping me][ping] if I don't respond.
Also see ["I emailed my customer asking multiple questions. Their reply
addressed only one. What is the polite way to point this out?"][multiq]; i.e. I
will try to respond to every question or point, but sometimes I might not (for
whatever reason).
If you really want an answer, feel free to re-ask the question/restate the
point.

See the page on [account names]() for account names I use on various websites.
You can try to contact me through those sites (if they offer a messaging
feature) but I can't guarantee I will check them often.

You can stalk me online (e.g. by following me on Quora or Facebook or by
reading what I have on this website).
I also don't mind if you ask questions about me on Quora, if you want to
passively contact me that way, though I don't control what Quora allows.
