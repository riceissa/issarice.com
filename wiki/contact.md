Below are some ways to contact me, as well as the account names I use on various websites.
Feel free to connect with me through any of the means below.
I am most responsive via email, Facebook, and Quora (I may not check other sites very often).
You can also stalk me online (e.g. by following me on Quora or Facebook, or by reading what I have on this website).
I also don't mind if you ask questions about me on Quora, though recently Quora has gotten stricter about what sorts of personal questions are allowed[^bnbr].

[^bnbr]: In general, you should be fine as long as you follow Quora's “[Be Nice, Be Respectful](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Quoras-Be-Nice-Be-Respectful-policy)” policy; it matters less whether the person about whom the question is asked is fine with it.

# General

- My email address is [riceissa@gmail.com](mailto:riceissa@gmail.com).
- You can also send me anonymous feedback using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AbwmuMIyzB5X7P4ysL71vGD4WnMxsCKsAZULLc0X7V0/viewform?usp=send_form) (idea from [lukeprog](http://lesswrong.com/lw/8bt/tell_me_what_you_think_of_me/) and [Gwern](http://www.gwern.net/About#anonymous-feedback)).
- I have an [identification photo](./identification-photo.jpg) in case you'd like to know what I look like.

# Social

- I spend much of my time on [Quora](https://quora.com) now.
My Quora profile is [here](https://www.quora.com/Issa-Rice).
- My [Facebook]() profile is [here](https://www.facebook.com/riceissa).
I check Facebook regularly throughout the day.
I generally accept all friend requests that don’t appear to be spam; having a [decent profile photograph](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Using_Facebook_effectively#Profile_photograph) or at least one mutual friend will let me know that your profile is genuine.
- My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) profile is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=352995114).
I don’t use LinkedIn very much, but feel free to connect with me.
- I have an [OkCupid](http://www.okcupid.com/) profile [here](http://www.okcupid.com/profile/riceissa) that has fairly extensive information about me (though a lot of it is identical to my self-description above).
Feel free to connect with me as friends or romantically (or both).
- I am [riceissa](https://twitter.com/riceissa) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/).
I don’t use Twitter very often, and when I do it’s mostly to read what others have tweeted.
