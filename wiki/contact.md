Below are some ways to contact me (Issa Rice), as well as the account
names[^aname] I use on various websites.  Feel free to connect with me
through any of the means below.  I am most responsive via email and
Facebook (I may not check other sites very often).
I try to respond to everyone who contacts me, but [for various reasons](http://lesswrong.com/lw/eua/reasons_for_someone_to_ignore_you/ "“Reasons for someone to ‘ignore’ you” by Wei Dai") I might not; feel free to ping me if I don't respond.^[Also see [I emailed my customer asking multiple questions\. Their reply addressed only one\. What is the polite way to point this out?](https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/44483/i-emailed-my-customer-asking-multiple-questions-their-reply-addressed-only-one); i.e. I will try to respond to every question or point, but sometimes I might not (for whatever reason). If you really want an answer, feel free to re-ask the question/restate the point.]
You can also stalk
me online (e.g. by following me on Quora or Facebook or by reading what
I have on this website).  I also don't mind if you ask questions about
me on Quora, though recently Quora has gotten stricter about what sorts
of personal questions are allowed[^bnbr].

[^aname]: I usually use "riceissa" on most sites. This is somewhat of a
historical accident: when I tried signing up for my Gmail account,
"issarice" was already taken, so I picked "riceissa" instead. Since
then, I've sort of standardized on "riceissa" for most services, although I also use "issarice".

[^bnbr]: In general, you should be fine as long as you follow Quora's
“[Be Nice, Be Respectful][bnbr]” policy; it matters less whether the
person about whom the question is asked is fine with it.
