I am taking the idea of status tags [from gwern](http://www.gwern.net/About#belief-tags).
Here is his original explanation, though my use (explained below) differs slightly.

> The "status" tag describes the state of completion: whether it's a
> pile of links & snippets & "notes", or whether it is a "draft" which
> at least has some structure and conveys a coherent thesis, or it's a
> well-developed draft which could be described as "in progress", and
> finally when a page is done - in lieu of additional material turning
> up - it is simply "finished".

Below is how I use status tags:

Notes
:    Same as gwern, i.e. for pages that are just collections of links and quotes.
I also use this for brief posts in general; one can treat them like Facebook status updates---except, they might eventually build up to something more.

Draft
:    Same as gwern, i.e. for pages that have a rough direction but aren't solid.

In progress
:    Same as gwern, i.e. for pages that fairly solid but aren't very polished or meticulous.

Mostly finished
:    For pages that I consider mostly done, needing only minor corrections.

I prefer to think of my writings as continuously improving drafts, partly because I might obtain better feedback.
For instance [Anne Ruggles Gere writes](https://books.google.com/books?id=4NPCUmKBxO8C&lpg=PA75&ots=VBeEGQ5hyM&dq=anne%20ruggles%20gere%20when%20participants%20in%20writing%20groups%20read%20finished%20writing&pg=PA75#v=onepage&q=anne%20ruggles%20gere%20when%20participants%20in%20writing%20groups%20read%20finished%20writing&f=false) (quoted in "[Shutting Down Tolkien](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/slides/2014-08-pygotham/#anne-ruggles-gere)" by Brandon Rhodes):

> [W]hen participants in writing groups read "finished" writing, the
> language of the group often became acerbic or vacuous because members
> felt (perhaps unconsciously) that they had no purpose.

"This page is a draft, so the content on here might be incomplete, unpolished, incorrect, or otherwise not up to the same level of quality as finished pages. Also note that this page was created to externalize some ideas; these ideas are in no way endorsed."
