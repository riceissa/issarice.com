This page is about the status notices (or tags) that are displayed at
the top of pages of this site.  The **status** efficiently communicates
to the reader at what stage of development a particular page is.  In
practice, it's mostly useful as a shorthand for something to the effect
of "This page is a draft, so the content on here might be incomplete,
unpolished, incorrect, or otherwise not up to the same level of quality
as finished pages."

I took the idea of status tags [from gwern][gw st].  Here is his
original explanation, though my use (explained below) differs slightly.

[gw st]: http://www.gwern.net/About#belief-tags

> The "status" tag describes the state of completion: whether it's a
> pile of links & snippets & "notes", or whether it is a "draft" which
> at least has some structure and conveys a coherent thesis, or it's a
> well-developed draft which could be described as "in progress", and
> finally when a page is done - in lieu of additional material turning
> up - it is simply "finished".

Below is how I use status tags:

Notes
:    Same as gwern, i.e. for pages that are just collections of links
and quotes.  I also use this for brief posts in general; one can treat
them like Facebook status updates, except that they might eventually
build up to something more.

Draft
:    Same as gwern, i.e. for pages that have a rough direction but
aren't solid.

In progress
:    Same as gwern, i.e. for pages that are fairly solid but aren't very
polished or meticulous.

Mostly finished
:    For pages that I consider mostly done, needing only minor
corrections.

I prefer to think of my writings as continuously improving drafts, partly because I might obtain better feedback.
For instance [Anne Ruggles Gere writes][arg] (quoted in "[Shutting Down Tolkien]" by Brandon Rhodes):
