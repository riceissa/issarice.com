Currently this site does not have native comments.
If you'd like to give me feedback (which I would really appreciate), just [contact]() me directly.
In addition, some pages will have a link at the bottom (usually under "External links" or "See also") where I will link to an external (usually Facebook) discussion of the page.

For my thoughts on commenting in general, see my [Comments]() page.

If you'd like to point out corrections, instead of contacting me, it's also possible to submit a pull request through the [GitHub repository for this site](https://github.com/riceissa/issarice.com).
