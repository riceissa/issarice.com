This page is a linkdump of my readings related to taxonomies. I am interested in taxonomies for reasons similar to my interest in [timelines](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Main_Page).

the figures in this paper are interesting <http://www.landwehr.org/1994secflawtaxcsurv.pdf>

Section 1.4 of *[Ethical Intuitionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_Intuitionism_(book))* has two taxonomies of metaethical views.

> As the preceding section suggests, metaethical theories are traditionally
> divided first into realist and anti-realist views, and then into two forms of
> realism and three forms of anti-realism:
>
> ```
>            Naturalism
>           /
>    Realism
>   /       \
>  /         Intuitionism
> /
> \
>  \              Subjectivism
>   \            /
>    Anti-Realism -- Non-Cognitivism
>                \
>                 Nihilism
> ```
>
> This is not the most illuminating way of classifying positions. It implies
> that the most fundamental division in metaethics is between realists and
> anti-realists over the question of objectivity. The dispute between
> naturalism and intuitionism is then seen as relatively minor, with the
> naturalists being much closer to the intuitionists than they are, say, to the
> subjectivists. That isn't how I see things. As I see it, the most fundamental
> division in metaethics is between the intuitionists, on the one hand, and
> everyone else, on the other. I would classify the positions as follows:
>
> ```
>    Dualism -- Intuitionism
>   /
>  /                      Subjectivism
> /                      /
> \          Reductionism
>  \        /            \
>   \      /              Naturalism
>    Monism
>          \               Non-Cognitivism
>           \             /
>            Eliminativism
>                         \
>                          Nihilism
> ```
