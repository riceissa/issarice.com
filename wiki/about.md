# Self-introduction

<!--
At some point i ought to rewrite this section. here are some ideas i guess.

I've thought about various ways to introduce myself. some people call themselves artists, or creators, or they want to have the greatest impact on the world, or they want to be remembered, or ...
I can definitely feel some aspect of each of those identities in myself.
But when I really ask myself, "am I an artist?" or something, it doesn't quite fit.
because I _like_ the aesthetic of gondola too, of just observing the world.
sometimes i like pain, and thinking about how horrifying the world is.
i don't want to be boring, but i also like canonical things, plain things, simple things. i like non-arbitrary non-artificial things.
So a big part of "what it's like to be me" is in noticing all these contradictions, and trying to manage this mess. it's exhausting and exciting at the same time.
From the inside it feels like i've often chosen meaningfulness over comfort.

What even is the point of a self-introduction? I sort of want to transmit this "what it's like"-ness of being me. but also the more straightforward purpose is for other people to judge me, to make an impression on other people, to tell other people "what it's like to be around me".

in terms of world views... talk about my big picture beliefs.

By day I am a freelance researcher. Since 2016 I have been regularly
working with [Vipul Naik](https://vipulnaik.com/), doing a mix of writing, programming, data collection, and other miscellaneous work. For the work I have
done for Vipul, see his [contract work portal page about me](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Issa+Rice).

In my free time I do a mix of writing and programming as well. You can
see my [work]() page or [portfolio]() page for a list of things I have
worked on (the "Payment" column being zero on the work page usually
indicates I worked on something in my free time). This website is also
something that I have created in my free time, although most pages are
notes so I don't list them on my work page.

# Contact

The best way to contact me is via email at
[riceissa@gmail.com](mailto:riceissa@gmail.com).

See my [contact]() page for more ways to contact me.

See the page on [account names]() for account names I use on various websites.
You can try to contact me through those sites (if they offer a messaging
feature) but I can't guarantee I will check them often.

# Photo

I have a [photo](identification-photo.jpg) you can use to identify me.
