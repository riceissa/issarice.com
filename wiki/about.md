I have two "About" pages:

- "[About me]()" contains information about myself (Issa Rice).
You will find my [self-introduction](about-me#self-introduction) as well as [contact information](about-me#contact) there.

- "[About the site]()" contains information about this website: its [philosophy](about-the-site#philosophy), [colophon](about-the-site#colophon), and [information on how to get updates](about-the-site#getting-updates).
