*Note that I have two About pages. This page is about myself (Issa Rice); for information about this website, see [About this site](). See also [Colophon]().*

# Self-introduction

Since 2016 I have been doing a lot of [contract
work](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Issa+Rice) for
[Vipul Naik](https://vipulnaik.com/).

# Contact

The best way to contact me is via email at
[riceissa@gmail.com](mailto:riceissa@gmail.com).

See my [contact]() page for more ways to contact me.

See the page on [account names]() for account names I use on various websites.
You can try to contact me through those sites (if they offer a messaging
feature) but I can't guarantee I will check them often.

# Photo

I have a [photo](identification-photo.jpg) you can use to identify me.
