# Self-introduction

My interests include

These days I spend most of my time on [Facebook]() and [Wikipedia]().

# Contact

The best way to contact me is via email at [riceissa@gmail.com][email].

See my [contact]() page for more ways to contact me.

See the page on [account names]() for account names I use on various websites.
You can try to contact me through those sites (if they offer a messaging
feature) but I can't guarantee I will check them often.

# Photo

I have [a photo](identification-photo.jpg) you can use to identify me.

# Name

See [How should I properly pronounce your name?]() for information about
my name.
