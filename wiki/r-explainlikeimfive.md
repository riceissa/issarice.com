[All-time top posts on /r/explainlikeimfive](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/top/?sort=top&t=all).

I find this subreddit interesting.
There is a mix of questions about:

  * computing
  * "everyday questions" that people might think up
  * processes that are hidden from everyday life: details of manufacturing, how
    things are priced, etc.
  * things that require "evolutionary thinking"

As of December 11, 2016, there are 11.5 million "readers" (people who subscribe
to the subreddit, I believe), and over 5,000 logged-in users viewing the
subreddit in the past 15 minutes (I write this on a Sunday afternoon), so it
seems quite popular.
