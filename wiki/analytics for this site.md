title: Analytics for this site

I use Google Analytics to track traffic to this site.
In the interest of transparency, I release some summary data here.

Note that I use the [[Firefox]] plugin NoScript to disable JavaScript from
google-analytics.com, so this shouldn't count my own views of the site (for the
most part).

Around the end of June 2015 (I think) I realized that Google Analytics wasn't
doing a good job of filtering out fake referral spam, which was artificially
driving up pageviews.
To counter this, I implemented some filters to exclude certain referrals.
However, Google Analytics can only show graphs for filtered views since the
time when the filter was created.
Thus the graph below includes the months July 1, 2015 through October 31, 2016,
with monthly granularity.
