My [[sleep schedule]] has often been quite bad. Here's a method I've been using in March 2023 that has been working quite well for me.

Some warnings/caveats:

- I haven't tested this with anyone else, so $n=1$.
- I've only been using it with success for almost a month. Who knows if it will keep working for me in the long run.
- It assumes you can mostly maintain your existing schedule, no matter how dysfunctional. If you have something like DSPS where your sleep schedule keeps getting worse and worse over the course of a single week, this method will not (on its own) work.
- I am assuming that the problem is that you go to sleep too late and wake up too late. For example, sleeping at 3am and waking up at noon.

With that out of the way, here's the basic plan:

1. First, _without changing your schedule at all_, set up a bunch of alarms on your phone for when you would _normally do things you already do_. I have alarms for:
	- wake up
	- take mid-day medications
	- take flax ground seeds
	- take night time medications
	- shut down computer
	- brush teeth
2. Keep going about your life as usual, not changing your schedule at all. Just get used to the idea of "do things when alarm rings" instead of "do things because it's a certain time on the clock". I recommend maybe a week or more at this stage. (I had already been doing this step for my medications for a long time, so when I used this method for my sleep schedule, I basically skipped this step.)
3. Now, shift back the alarms by 5--10 minutes each day. Every time you shift back by a full hour, I recommend staying there for maybe a week just to make sure there is not even any minimal jet lag. (I think the sensitivity of shifting back varies a lot by person. I think I'm generally a lot more sensitive to jet lag than most people, so that's why I'm recommending stopping and staying after each hour moved back.)
4. Keep going until you reach your desired wake up and/or sleep time.

Some notes:

- Depending on how long you stayed at steps (1) and (2), you may need to keep adjusting the spacings between the alarms throughout the other steps. For example, I've been aiming to get 9.5 hours of sleep, but I notice that when the "brush teeth" alarm rings, I'm still eating food most of the time. So decided to push my "shut down computer" to happen earlier while keeping the "brush teeth" alarm where it is, so that I get a longer warning.
- I recommend not setting any alarms during the daytime, as I think people's schedules are quite variable during this time (e.g. on weekdays someone might be at school or work which requires eating lunch at a certain time, but on the weekends they might eat lunch whenever). However, I did this any due to some medications I have to take. I think morning/nighttime tends to be more consistent for most people.
- I recommend not setting too many alarms, as that may make the alarms annoying. You don't want the alarms to feel annoying, because that makes you more likely to just reflexively turn them off without doing the thing the alarm is telling you to do.
