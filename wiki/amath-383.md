This is my course review for AMATH 383, continuous modeling.
I took the course in Autumn 2015 with Hong Qian.
The text we used is KK Tung's *Topics in Mathematical Modeling*.

# Content

- Introduction to difference equations, Poisson deriving distribution
- Qian does a lot of tedious algebra on the board...I don't get the sense that most of the class is paying any attention, but he's still a talented lecturer.
