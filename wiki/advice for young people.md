**Warning:** i'm making a bunch of changes to this page as of 2018--2020, so right
now it's a weird mix of things i believed in 2014--2015 plus things i currently
believe (in 2018--2020).

# What this page is about

In high school it is common to feel the frustration described in the
introductory paragraph for [[Cognito Mentoring]]:

> You love learning. You spend a lot of time reading fiction or learning
> about science or solving math problems or all of the above. School
> doesn’t meet your intellectual needs. Classes often emphasize rote
> memorization of disjointed collections of facts. You only know a few
> people who you can talk about ideas with. You wish you had more, and
> you wish you had better perspective on what there is to learn and how
> best to learn it.

While the [Cognito Mentoring info wiki][CM_wiki] provides excellent
general advice, here I hope to give more specialized advice; in
particular, this page is tailored toward my past self, and documents
advice/"cheat codes"/"redpills" that I wish I had gotten while I was in high school.  Therefore
this page is unlikely to suit most people (since the target audience is
my past self, and I tend to be unusual by most standards).  Another way
to describe this page is to say it is a list of all the things that have
profoundly influenced and inspired me up to this point.  Yet another
description of this page: it's my attempt to counter the farce that is
present-day "liberal arts education" (which aims to help people develop
"critical thinking"); I want to give my own version of a **true liberal
arts education**. As such, you should expect it to take several years to
actually absorb most of the content on this page, if you actually take
advantage of the opportunities (by exploring all the sites I link to, reaching
out to people, going out and actually doing things that are suggested, and so
on).

# School

My thoughts on school as of late 2018:

- I really wish I had tried harder to escape school much earlier. By junior
  high, it was obvious that I hated school and that escaping was better.
  Why didn't I actually quit school? \[insert long list of excuses\]
  Don't make the same mistake!
  If quitting school seems *impossible*, then, well, [*shut up and do the
  impossible*](http://lesswrong.com/lw/up/shut_up_and_do_the_impossible/)!

[Marcus Geduld](https://www.quora.com/What-should-I-do-to-get-over-my-fear-of-public-failure/answer/Marcus-Geduld):

> “\[S\]chool \[...\] is a pathological environment. It's pathological,
> because it sells itself as a  “place of learning” while shunning the
> best learning tool there is \[i.e. failure\].  In school, the worst
> thing you can do is fail. If you fail seriously enough, you get “held
> back” or, at the very least, you get branded with an F. School teaches
> you to loath failing, which is basically teaching you to loath
> learning.”

Some other points:

- Sometimes it's good just to know that you are not the only one who is
  extremely frustrated with high school.  Even conventionally successful
  intellectuals like Noam Chomsky hated high school; see [my answer to the
  Quora question "What would Noam Chomsky think of
  unschooling?"](https://www.quora.com/What-would-Noam-Chomsky-think-of-unschooling/answer/Issa-Rice),
  for instance.

- ["Drawbacks to Formal Education"][drawbacks] by Brian Tomasik

- ["Free the Education
  Market"](http://www.daveshellenberger.com/free-the-education-market) by
  David Shellenberger

- Looking at the resources on [[Cognito Mentoring]] is a good idea.

- In general, however, it's probably best to [stay mainstream until you
  have demonstrated success doing unusual stuff][mainstream].

- One can treat the system like a constraint (CM), like a day job (Paul
  Graham), etc.

-   Actively search for alternatives.  For example, if one lives in Washington
    State, then the early entrance programs at UW might be one option. See for
    instance [Alex K. Chen's review][acad] on Quora.

## Paul Graham

Entrepreneur Paul Graham writes good essays on various topics, including
high school.  Even [Vipul Naik](http://vipulnaik.com) of [[Cognito Mentoring]] [highly respects Paul Graham][ob_graham]:

[ob_graham]: http://openborders.info/blog/paul-graham-us-immigration-policy-high-tech-programmers/

The primary essay Graham has on frustration with high school is "[What
You'll Wish You'd Known](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html)" (which
tells students to treat high school like a day job so they can do more
important things outside of school).  His "[Why Nerds are
Unpopular](http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html)" may also be of
interest.^[Related are Bryan Caplan's "[Redistribution: Blocking the Revenge of the Nerds?](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/06/redistribution_1.html)" and [Geoffrey Widdison's answer to Why are people with higher IQ generally not very physically attractive?](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-people-with-higher-IQ-generally-not-very-physically-attractive/answer/Geoffrey-Widdison).]  Below are the parts from "Why Nerds are Unpopular" that most
resonated with me:

## Peter Thiel

From "[Peter Thiel: Education = the Catholic Church circa 1500](http://vator.tv/news/2014-11-22-peter-thiel-education-the-catholic-church-circa-1500)" (HT Alex):

> There is something very odd about a society where the most talented

From "[Is Peter Thiel the Martin Luther of Education?](http://vator.tv/news/2014-12-03-is-peter-thiel-the-martin-luther-of-education)" (HT Alex again):

And HT Alex again, from "[Peter Thiel -- Conversations with Tyler](https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/peter-thiel-on-the-future-of-innovation-77628a43c0dd)":

# Rationality community and resources

Since about 2007, there has been a growing community---both online and
offline---based around the idea of "rationality", i.e. the idea that
[one should (1) have beliefs that correspond to reality, and (2) execute
actions in the real world so as to achieve one's goals][rationality].
Learning about rationality is valuable in itself, but there is also an
aspect of being in a "rationalist community" that appeals to many.

[rationality]: http://lesswrong.com/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/

I think the best places to look are: LessWrong, gwern's site, and Slate
Star Codex (a blog by Scott Alexander).  In fact, both gwern and Scott
Alexander are active users of LW who chose to branch off to their own
websites.

In particular, for high school students, 

## LessWrong

It is however important to emphasize that having a good fit with the
community of LW may be important.  For instance, I know several
intelligent people who cannot stand LW.

- find more high school-related posts.

Main page: [[LessWrong]].

## gwern

[gwern][gwern_lw] is probably one of the most well-known users on
LessWrong.  He also has a [website][gwern] that has numerous essays on
everything from nootropics to Wikipedia editing.  His notion of [Long
Content][g about] is also especially inspiring: "if one holds onto every
glimmer of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit
like a genius himself".  For high school students especially, the essays
"[On Stress]" and "[On Disrespect]" may be of interest.  His [stories][g
stories] also tend to have "lessons" (like Kafka's parables) and are
entertaining to read.

[gwern_lw]: http://lesswrong.com/user/gwern/
[gwern]: http://www.gwern.net/
[g about]: http://www.gwern.net/About
[on stress]: http://www.gwern.net/On%20Stress
[on disrespect]: http://www.gwern.net/On%20Disrespect
[g stories]: http://www.gwern.net/Notes#stories

I think part of the appeal of gwern is that he inspires many people
because his website doesn't look like "magic"; one can agree that, given
enough time, anyone can attempt what he did.

One thing that gwern does particularly well is emphasizing the
importance of planning for the long term.  For instance he uses free
software, URL archival tools, plain text for his site, etc.


## Slate Star Codex

[Slate Star Codex] is an interesting blog ranging in topics from romance
to social justice to reactionary politics.  See the [top posts][ssc top]
for more.  He is particularly good at [steelmanning] opponents'
arguments.  He is also good at picking out useful content on the
internet, especially from Reddit (displayed on his recurring links
posts).

[ssc top]: http://slatestarcodex.com/top-posts/
[steelmanning]: http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2012/12/the-virtue-of-steelmanning/

The "[graduation speech]" Scott gives may be of interest.  I think it's
entertaining to read, and makes some good points, but ultimately doesn't
do anything new.  (In other words, I think Paul Graham's essays already
provide a lot of the heuristics of the argument; Scott does do a better
job of linking to sources and using numbers though.) I get the feeling
that my views didn't change after reading this, though perhaps for some,
reading the article will give more coherence to their ideas.  The
conclusion is specifically disappointing, since it abruptly ends with
"kindness is what's important".  The essay also doesn't provide much
that is actionable; one is left wondering "Okay, so what do *I* do?" (In
this sense I think Cognito Mentoring does a much better job.)

[graduation speech]: http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/23/ssc-gives-a-graduation-speech/

Scott Alexander also has an older website called [Raikoth], which has
the [The Consequentialism FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20141231113651/http://www.raikoth.net/consequentialism.html).

# Depression

As of late 2018, my basic take on depression:

- While I was depressed, depression sometimes seemed like a pretty interesting
  mental state to be in.  However, now that I have been not depressed for a
  long time, looking back, I see that depression was not an interesting mental
  state after all.  That is to say, you should try to escape the depressed
  state as soon as possible!
- Despite being a "materialist" (in the consciousness sense), I think I didn't
  take materialism seriously enough, and in my day-to-day life, I was still
  implicitly acting like a dualist.  Specifically, I wasn't acting as if things
  like sleep, a good diet, being hydrated, and exercise were important.
- In my case, I think my depression was primarily due to being stuck in school
  and not taking care of myself (see previous bullet point).

---

old version:

High school can be a source of depression, since it is essentially
[child abuse].  Depression can in turn cause other problems.  I'm not
really an expert on the topic, but you can read my page on
[[Depression]].

I also do more academic research into depression as an effective
altruism cause on the [Depression page on the Cause Prioritization
Wiki][cp dep].

[cp dep]: http://causeprioritization.org/Depression

See also pages like "[Existential depression in gifted individuals][ex
dep],
which has passages like:

Another page, "[Vulnerabilities of highly gifted children][vul gif]",
which has:

[eliezer](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/YduZEfz8usGbJXN4x/transcription-of-eliezer-s-january-2010-video-q-and-a):

i disagree with the last sentence. i think my loneliness has gotten
much worse as i've learned about the world. as i become more sane,
everyone else looks more and more insane. eventually it can seem like
the only way to make more friends is to actually _create_ more smart
people in the world, rather than just _finding_ them!

From "[Existential depression in gifted individuals](http://www.davidsongifted.org/db/Articles_id_10269.aspx)":

In some sense, effective altruism is an answer to the questions "What
should I do with my life?", "Can I do anything meaningful with my
life?", etc.

Although effective altruists claim that effective altruism is [a
question, not an ideology](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/9s/effective_altruism_is_a_question_not_an_ideology/), if you pay enough attention, each
subset of effective altruists clearly has its own agenda.  So you
can't necessarily trust EAs.

I liked this article by Larissa MacFarquhar: "[Extreme altruism: should you care for strangers at the expense of your family?](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/extreme-altruism-should-you-care-for-strangers-as-much-as-family)"


# Online presence and content creation

My main page on this is [Content creation: the organization and
dissemination of knowledge](content-creation).

See also "[Maintaining your online presence][online p]" on the Cognito
Mentoring wiki.

[online p]: http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Maintaining_your_online_presence

I think now that content creation may be one of the best ways to produce
lasting value.  It's always best to think in the long term; practicing a
sport, for instance, may provide short-term satisfaction, but in the
long term (say, after ten years) it is difficult to say what overall
effect the sport had.  (There are obviously creative ways to provide
value even with a sport, e.g. by recording it and therefore providing
entertainment even after one has stopped playing.)

Another point: if you're *extremely unusual* compared to the
mainstream/masses, then chances are, you'll have trouble finding
appropriate peers in real life.  This is why it's important to expand
your search online, and one of the ways to get people's attention online
is by producing great content.

2020 update: i think when you are younger, you should focus more on
producing "obvious" or reference works. writing timelines or wikipedia
articles is a good start. or helping a more senior person's research
(e.g. by digging). the reason for this is that when you're young, your
ideas will basically all be bad. this is probably field-dependent,
e.g. in math or more technical subjects you could probably do good
work even when you don't understand the world very well. but for
philosophy, EA-like worldview building, and stuff like
politics/opinions your opinions will just be bad. you could still keep
a blog/diary but i wouldn't suggest putting in a huge number of hours
(e.g. researching something in politics and writing it up as a blog
post seems like a bad idea).

as you get older, you will hopefully "go woke" in some sense. i'm not
really sure how to explain what this is like or how you would know
that e.g. you're "going woke" instead of going crazy. one sort of
litmus test of sorts is to try reading a bunch of [[Wei Dai]] blog
posts. if you don't bounce off, if you instead have thoughts like "wtf
this guy is so amazing" then you _might_ be on the right track :). i
think it's easy to have "wtf gwern is amazing" thoughts at like age
15--17, but for wei, it might be more like 20--25 (depending on how
much info you consume in your teens).

once you go woke, you can start to do basically anything. like, if
you're hanson/caplan-pilled on politics, weipilled on philosophy, and
carl/eliezer-pilled on various other aspects of the world, then you
can actually start to think non-dumb thoughts about many topics. so at
this point, you can trust yourself to write about
politics/society/love/whatever, and it won't be predictably-obviously
bad. (it might still be bad, but it will probably be bad in
non-obvious/interesting ways.)

# Thinking about careers

My basic stance on careers as of late 2018 [updated August 2020]:

- If you share my values, then I think not working at a crushing day job is
  important.  Many people complain that they hate their job/complain about
  "bullshit jobs", but then they keep working at such a job.  It seems to me
  that these people (1) actually secretly like their jobs or buy into
  the protestant work ethic so are on some level fine with wasting their lives
  away, (2) have competing interests, like earning enough money to buy
  things or impress actual/potential mates, or (3) are working at a day job
  temporarily as a way to build up a financial buffer or practice being
  functional.  In the case of (1), I can't really
  help you (you don't share my values). In the case of (2), I think you
  ought to introspect more and see if these things are really worth it.
  In the case of (3), I think this is fine, and you should keep doing this
  until you feel ready to quit/move onto the next stage of your life.

2020: the hardest thing about careers is how to make enough money to
support a wife and kids (if that's what you want). all of this is
assuming AI timelines are like 40+ years away. living a minimal single
existence is easy just by doing freelance work/working a programming
(or other high-paying) job for a small number of years. (i'm still not
entirely sure why grognor couldn't do this.) but once you get to
wife+kids, everything is much harder, and i still haven't figured this
one out. check back in a few more years! :')

From June 2021:

I think cucking is fine if it's for:
- short-term for building up some financial buffer
- immigration status, if the country you work in is meaningfully better than your original country for your goals
- practice for being functional
- people who actually don't have ambition and just want a decent life without planning too much
- people for whom the money/status is actually a terminal goal

everything else is kind of meh or actively repulsive to me

# Finding content online

One useful skill to have is identifying useful content online (something that
is not taught in schools).  Here are some places to check out:

- [My guide on reddit](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Using_reddit)
- For maximum transparency, I've released [my Atom/RSS
  subscriptions](https://issarice.com/urls.txt) (with some confidential URLs
  removed) publicly.

# Identifying good people

I've moved this section to <https://wiki.issarice.com/wiki/People_watching#Identifying_good_people>

(see my [People page](people) for my specific recommendations, so you can
judge whether you think i know what i'm talking about)

# Books

As of late 2018, my basic view on books is that books are pretty useful, and
there are some great books out there, but books tend to be overrated by
intellectualist types (but, strangely, underrated among the people I interact
with most).  I think one ought not weight books more heavily owing to their
length; treat them kind of like blog posts.  To read a book, don't read it
cover to cover; rather, skim it and try to find something interesting in it. If
there is nothing interesting in the book, just toss it.  Unless a book is
really good, if you are reading it cover to cover, you are doing it wrong.

Some books I have enjoyed:

- Dawkins's *Selfish Gene*
- Bryan Caplan's *[Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids](http://deletionpedia.org/en/Selfish_Reasons_to_Have_More_Kids)*
    - See also [an overview](http://lesswrong.com/lw/col/review_selfish_reasons_to_have_more_kids/) on [[LessWrong]]
- Gary Drescher's _Good and Real_
- Daniel Dennett's _Consciousness Explained_
- Michael Huemer's _The Problem of Political Authority_
- Eliezer Yudkowsky's _Sequences_ (note: the published book version cuts out comments and some of the posts. I think <https://www.readthesequences.com/> is a good start, especially if you wouldn't bother reading any of it otherwise, but eventually you may want to use GW/LW to read all the comments and omitted posts) and _Inadequate Equilibria_

# Extracurriculars

My basic 2018 stance on extracurriculars:

- I think almost all extracurricular activities, especially the common ones
  (sports, practicing an instrument, becoming a club leader), are intrinsically
  (i.e., ignoring signaling benefits) useless in the long run.  The case
  becomes even stronger once you consider opportunity costs.
- If you feel like you are being left behind by your peers by not doing
  respectable extracurriculars, then try as much as possible to ignore this
  social aspect of your environment.  Ignoring one's social environment is a
  useful skill to learn.
- If one wants to attend an elite college, then doing respectable
  extracurriculars may be worth the cost.  I'm not an expert on this subject.

# Doing hard things, doing something important

Richard Hamming's famous talk, "[You and Your Research]" is *very*
inspirational.  There is a [video of the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw), though I think
reading it is better, since I don't particularly like the way he gives
the talk.

[you and your research]: http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html

Some good quotes (emphasis mine):

> In order to get at you individually, I must talk in the first person.
> I have to get you to drop modesty and say to yourself, “**Yes, I would
> like to do first-class work.**” Our society frowns on people who set out
> to do really good work. You're not supposed to; luck is supposed to
> descend on you and you do great things by chance. Well, that's a kind
> of dumb thing to say. I say, **why shouldn't you set out to do something
> significant. You don't have to tell other people, but shouldn't you
> say to yourself, “Yes, I would like to do something significant.”**

Another:

> Another trait, it took me a while to notice. I noticed the following
> facts about people who work with the door open or the door closed. I
> notice that if you have the door to your office closed, you get more
> work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most.
> But 10 years later somehow you don't know quite know what problems are
> worth working on; all the hard work you do is sort of tangential in
> importance. He who works with the door open gets all kinds of
> interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the
> world is and what might be important. Now I cannot prove the cause and
> effect sequence because you might say, “The closed door is symbolic of

> correlation between those who work with the doors open and those who

> closed often work harder. Somehow they seem to work on slightly the
> wrong thing - not much, but enough that they miss fame.

And:

> I started asking, “What are the important problems of your field?” And

# Academia

Beware of the "tunnel vision" of mathematics and physics (and other STEM
fields too), in which people consider these fields to be their "calling"
and won't look into anything else.  In particular, while knowing about
the possibilities of academia is important, *going to graduate school
should not be one's default path*.  As [Holden Karnofsky of GiveWell
says][holden interview], regarding academia, "\[p\]eople usually either
completely ignore that possibility or they completely ignore every other
possibility".  Also you always have to remember [quotes like][phys
drugs] "I have known more people whose lives have been ruined by getting
a Ph.D. in physics than by drugs".  Remember that there also exist
blogs like [100 Reasons NOT to Go to Graduate School][no grad].

and "[Alternatives to
academia](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Alternatives_to_academia)".

A good thing to remember is that *there are already too many people in
academia*.  Academia is insanely crowded, and institutionally you're
very replaceable.  My personal opinion: just stay away from academia
unless you have a *very* good reason.  In particular, if you're neurotic
or mentally unstable *at all*, **just stay away**.  See also Bryan
Caplan's [forthcoming book on education](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/03/table_of_conten.html).  See also one of my absolute

# Computer skills

I've found it pretty useful to know how to use computers well. There are
several aspects to this:

- Programming.  I've found this useful for automating tasks, building websites,
  making money (through contract work), coding up small toy models to better understand a problem, and being able to read/understand
  software that others write.
- Algorithms and data structures.  Beyond basic programming skills, I haven't
  found knowledge of algorithms/data structures to be too useful.  Occasionally
  something may come up where having this knowledge is useful, but the vast
  majority of the time, basic programming skills suffice.  This might change in
  the future if I do work that is more intensive on this front.
  I think a big reason for this is that in high level programming languages,
  the abstractions are usually good.
- Familiarity with many websites/the internet.
- Unix tools/command line.  I've found this useful.  There are some things you
  can and maybe should skip or only learn the minimal amount of (bash
  programming comes to mind).
- Hardware.  I don't actually know much about computer hardware, and my current
  impression is that I haven't lost out on much by not knowing.

you can usually pick this up as you go, by e.g. reading online
tutorials, experimenting on your own, and occasionally working through
in a more systematic fashion (e.g. textbooks).

# Mathematics

- beware tunnel vision
- at the same time, knowing a lot of math can be useful
- once you go woke, it can be hard to go all in on math, so it might be good to do this while young
- usefulness of math depends on the subfield. e.g. i think statistics/probability and linear algebra are probably the most generally useful ones, and there are some things like complex analysis that i haven't learned (and i haven't had to learn so far).

# Learning how to learn

One of the things I most wish I could go back and tell my younger self is the importance of learning how to learn new things (in particular, hard technical subjects). The problem is that this topic tends to be dominated by fluffy books and articles, and thus tends to have a very low signal-to-noise ratio. I think I rightly judged much of this material as fluff, but what I did _not_ do was ask myself "huh, everything here sucks, so can I invent something better?" (I guess this is another lesson I would like to impart to my younger self, which is that many things suck in the world and [it's often possible to do better](https://equilibriabook.com/).)

Briefly, here are some principles to learning effectively (which I hope to expand on at some point):

- it's easier to learn a new thing than learn a specific new thing; this is the
  [de re vs de dicto distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_dicto_and_de_re).
  "it's easier to learn something (de dicto) than to learn something (de re)". (see also
  [this post](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/9EyzaH3jzH3PyQtM5/the-costs-of-reliability).)

  elaboration on this, copied from [here](https://github.com/riceissa/ama/issues/1):

  What I meant is that I could have a mindset like "I'm going to learn linear
  algebra this month, and will spend all my learning time on linear algebra"
  ("learn a specific new thing", de re) or I could have a mindset like "I'm
  going to learn some unspecified new thing each day, whatever it may be,
  depending on what I feel curious about on each day" ("learn a new thing", de
  dicto). I've found the latter to be much more enjoyable/easy for me.

  The connection with the de re vs de dicto terminology is that if I just say
  "Bob is going to learn something new today", it isn't immediately clear
  whether Bob has a specific thing in mind, just like in the [Wikipedia
  article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_dicto_and_de_re) sentences like
  "Peter believes someone is out to get him" or "Jana wants to marry the
  tallest man in Fulsom County" don't make it clear whether Peter or Jana has a
  specific someone in mind.

- spaced repetition works, but it's not magic, so you have to learn how to use it well. in particular, throwing cards at random into [[Anki]] is _not_ an effective way to learn. there are many pitfalls here.
- trust your sense of boredom, but also learn to cultivate it. if you're getting bored of something, there's usually a good reason for it (e.g. material is too easy or too difficult), and you can switch to learning something else. (there are similar lessons here, e.g. in mathematics you should trust your sense of aesthetics, but also learn to develop it in response to new mathematics)
- putting math problems into anki works well for remembering math, but there are many subtleties involved, in order to make sure you stick with it.
- just reading is not enough (by a lot) for learning new math. you have to do some combination of doing the exercises in the book, coming up with your own exercises, asking questions, checking assumptions for theorems, [a bunch of stuff for definitions](https://learning.subwiki.org/wiki/Understanding_mathematical_definitions), cross-reading multiple books+wikipedia (some books use nonstandard notation or definitions and don't tell you).
- making concepts intuitive vs passably being able to work with them (see satvik beri's answer on quora)
- learn what it feels like when material is: too easy, too hard, just right.
- learn to tell the difference between pointless pedantry (e.g. insisting that functions are sets) and useful pedantry (e.g. checking edge cases like those involving the empty set)
- there is something like an "optimal order" for learning undergraduate math. i'm not entirely sure what this order is, but i have some idea of the pieces (e.g. metric spaces before general topology)
- some books have polarizing reviews (e.g. baby rudin is "the best book on analysis" or it is "way too terse"). this is a hint that the book has an "optimal background" for it, and you should think about what this background might be.
- in the beginning, write out the gory details of proofs.
- some weird ego/self-esteem issues: learning to be okay with being confused/stuck, learning to be ok with not solving a problem instantly, being ok with being a beginner.
- many explanations suck, but sometimes the solution isn't to go find a different explanation. many math textbooks are written in a way that assumes you will be putting in a lot of work, but they don't explicitly tell you this. often things get mysteriously easier when you play around with concrete examples.
- "learn a bunch of things well in the next year" is easier than "learn this one thing well in the next month"
- i had the mistaken impression when i was younger that i was a "quick learner" or that i was already "good at learning" because i was able to get good grades in school. it was only when i was learning things which were actually hard and actually required thinking that i realized i wasn't retaining as much of it as i thought i should.
  - high school math (in the US at least) is a joke. many topics have a very short "window" -- you don't need to retain things for very long at a time, so you can just cram/learn the algorithms by rote. you might not realize how much you don't actually know, because the problems in the book only ask you to execute some very specific algorithm.

Here is a brief description of how i learn math (as of August 2019):

1. i ask myself what seems most interesting to learn (usually i am working through some books or i have a specific thing i want to learn)
2. i read for a bit. anytime i come across something interesting/new, i add it to anki. (this part needs a lot of explanation)
3. if i come across a part of a book that requires some sort of verification, i do that, using pencil and a notebook.
4. i work out some exercises or make up my own. after i finish an exercise, if it was not a too tedious one, i write it up and add it to anki (in a separate problems deck). writing this up sometimes catches subtle errors i had in my original reasoning. while i do this, i might also search up solutions to see if there is a better way to do it. This deck is designed so that i see this problem only about a month later, which is a good test to see if i've successfully internalized the material. for writing up proofs in anki, it's better to err on the side of being pedantic/meticulous, because in a few months you may have forgotten subtle things which cause small errors in your proof (which would be hard to notice if your proof writeup is hand-wavy).
5. if i encounter something i don't understand, i write a question down, in a notebook or text file or maybe math SE. sometimes, i will be able to answer this question in a few months, after i've learned more things. but other times, it's something that seems difficult to answer, so i don't get a quick answer. (I haven't tried this, but it might be good to find a [tutor](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/tmWMuY5HCSNXXZ9oq/buck-s-shortform/comment/dcR3jmeZBc3EdDbrh) in the subject and ask them all your questions. One problem for me is that many of the things i want to learn don't have tutors listed on wyzant.)
6. if i come up with a better explanation of something, or a better systematization, i will write it up. these days, i put these on the [ML subwiki userspace](https://machinelearning.subwiki.org/wiki/User:IssaRice).
7. in the evening, i go through my daily anki reviews (including the problems deck).

some additions since then (as of february 2020):

- sometimes adding stuff to anki is exhausting. if this is the case,
  it might be better to write a wiki page. that way, you will still be
  able to have a record/a way to load up your understanding when you
  come back to the topic later, but you won't need to constantly be
  nagged by anki into recalling the stuff. this is especially good for
  things that you're not sure you understand 100%, or stuff where aren't
  sure if you really want to retain it long-term.
- focus on simple examples that you can fit in your head all at once.

# People

*I've moved this section to [[People]].*

# Extreme worldviews

as carl says blah blah understand basic points of multiple worldviews.
with mainstream worldviews, you are likely to have exposure anyway.
with more extreme worldviews, you're not likely to come across some of them.
the goal is not to _adopt_ these worldviews, nor is the goal to just laugh them away. the goal is to (1) consider the arguments at the object level and see if they make sense, and to steal any insights they might contain; (2) at the meta level, ponder why some clearly intelligent people can write such clearly insane things.

with that out of the way, here are some specific suggestions:

- moldbug
- PUA
- ted kaczynski
- Bruce Charlton (medical hypotheses papers)
- accelerationists?

# Other ideas---expanding your imagination

Alex K. Chen often talks about the important of [expanding your
imagination of what's possible][expand].  Here I'll provide some of my
thoughts on how best to do that, in particular by giving examples of
things that have expanded my imagination.  In general, the best way to
do this is to just *read a lot* of things from a *very diverse set of
places*, and to interact with a lot of people as well.  It really helps
if you have a lot of friends who are into the newest things, because you
can learn a lot about the most exciting things that are happening.

- conventional intellectual heroes like Bertrand Russell, Feynman,

  how to stand up for something, apply critical thinking, etc.  However,
  compared to LW and the "new wave" of critical thinking in the

- I'm starting to think that colleges really are mostly useless.  In
  particular, if you put in effort to strengthen your online presence
  and find good peers online, then it's *very likely* that the people
  you can talk to online will be *much* better than the people you can
  talk to at your university.  (Though keep in mind potential benefits
  of talking to people in person.) In particular, *don't feel bad if you
  are lonely all the time*.  I tend to take the view that socializing
  with people from whom you will gain little is worse than not
  socializing at all.
- Even if you go to an elite school, are you *really* getting much out
  of the social scene?  Are the things you're learning in class *really*
  useful?

- Another thing (HT Alex again): documenting everything can be really important.
Part of this is to allow yourself to be stalkable (so it can lead to meeting more interesting people, providing value to them, and so forth), but also having access to a lot of the things you've done can remind you of all the *amazing* things you've done.

    Of course, it's very easy [to make fun of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_Take_Pictures_of_Each_Other) people who try to record things instead of "experiencing things", e.g. people who just write about people instead of "going out in the real world", or people who travel but only to take a bunch of photos.
    While this is a valid criticism, I do think that often it's possible to *do both* without much trouble.
    Participating online, for instance, is one way to "naturally" record things as you do them (this is one reason I like content creation so much).

    Also, it can *seem* embarrassing to have a lot of your "stupid" things you do online to last, but consider that *everyone else* also does a lot of stupid things online.
    It might be good to use a pseudonym while young, or to post things in places where it's easily privatable, but my suggestion would be to *never* permanently delete things.

Also think about how to get what you want in creative ways; in particular, watch out for situations like the following (by Katja Grace, quoted in Yvain's "[Diseased thinking: dissolving questions about disease](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2as/diseased_thinking_dissolving_questions_about/)"):

    > them personally. They sort recycling, buy free range eggs, buy
