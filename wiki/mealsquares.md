This page is my review of [MealSquares](https://www.mealsquares.com).

Since the recipe seems to have changed over time, I am eating the MealSquares sold as of November 2017. You can see the [nutrition facts page](https://web.archive.org/web/20171127100840/https://www.mealsquares.com/nutrition-facts.html "“Nutrition Facts”. MealSquares. Archived from the original (https://www.mealsquares.com/nutrition-facts.html) on November 27, 2017. Retrieved November 27, 2017.") of version I am eating.

To give context, Ethan Bashkansky offered me MealSquares that he had recently ordered. I first tasted a small bite when I wasn't hungry, and thought it tasted fine. Later that evening, when I became hungry, I had a whole MealSquare. Again, it tasted fine, but it was more satisfying because I was actually hungry.

What was most surprising to me was that the MealSquare, despite its size, cannot be eaten so quickly. Eating a whole MealSquare took me about 15 minutes, although I am a slow eater.

Overall I was impressed with MealSquares and might order some myself at some point.

In March 2022, I ordered a sample pack of 10 MealSquares.

I've noticed that at least in the batch I received, the chocolate chips are
mostly at the bottom, so microwaving right side up results in a lot of the
chocolate melting onto the plate (and then drying on the plate, which makes it
hard to scrape off to eat). So I have been microwaving and eating it upside
down, and this works well.

Multiple people online say MealSquares are dry, but I haven't really felt this
myself. I do sip water while eating it, but not any more than for other foods.
