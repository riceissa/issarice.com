I wrote this answer on Quora today in response to the question "I've completed my freshman year of university with a 4.0 GPA, yet I feel something is missing. How do I make college the most fulfilling, enlightening experience possible?"
You can read the answer on Quora [here](https://www.quora.com/Ive-completed-my-freshman-year-of-university-with-a-4-0-GPA-yet-I-feel-something-is-missing-How-do-I-make-college-the-most-fulfilling-enlightening-experience-possible/answer/Issa-Rice).
Although I don't mention it in my answer, the strategy outlined in my
answer is essentially one I am taking now at the [[University of Washington]].
File this under one of my [[advice for young people]].
