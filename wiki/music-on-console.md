For my music player, I use Music On Console (MOC).

To avoid keeping system-specific paths in the configuration file, one can pass
certain options when invoking the program:

    mocp -O MusicDir=/home/issa/Music -O FastDir1=/media/issa/wd1/Music

The above allows me to press `m` to visit the `Music` folder in my home
directory, and `!` to visit the `Music` folder on an external drive.

My configuration files are [available on
GitHub](https://github.com/riceissa/dotfiles/tree/master/.moc).
