Quora-style questions (I'm posting here because Quora has become less accepting of certain types of questions).
In general questions with variables in them or with items delimited by a slash ("/") are supposed to be question schemas; i.e. they are supposed to be separate questions.
See also [my answer](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-questions-that-could-be-asked-on-Quora-for-any-animal-species/answer/Issa-Rice) to "What are some good questions that could be asked on Quora for any animal species?" for more question schemas.
