It's obvious that a set of beliefs can imply certain predictions ("make your
beliefs pay rent", etc.), but what about the reverse?
Given an arbitrary statement *X*, is it possible to encode whether I believe
*X* by writing down a series of predictions?

Another way to phrase this is to consider the following scenario.
I want to find out whether someone believes *X*.
The person doesn't want to tell me whether they believe *X*.
However, they have agreed to make a bunch of predictions that I ask for.
Can I say whether they believe in *X* based the predictions (assuming they
don't lie in their predictions)?

To take a trivial example, any prediction like "The sun will rise tomorrow" can
just be passed along to the person, and they will have to answer truthfully.

Another example of a statement is "This is a fair coin".
The statement itself is *not a prediction*, so I'm not allowed to ask it
directly.
The way to find out whether the person believes the statement is to instead ask
"If I toss this coin 1,000,000 times, it will come up heads roughly half the
times" or something similar.
