It's obvious that a set of beliefs can imply certain predictions ("make your
beliefs pay rent", etc.), but what about the reverse?
Given an arbitrary statement *X*, is it possible to encode whether I believe
*X* by writing down a series of predictions?

Another way to phrase this is to consider the following scenario.
I want to find out whether someone believes *X*.
The person doesn't want to tell me whether they believe *X*.
However, they have agreed to make a bunch of predictions that I ask for.
