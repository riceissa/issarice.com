As part of this website, but also with publishing information in general (e.g. with my school projects, for instance), I've been very interested in things like [digital preservation](), [durable link]()s, and [single source publishing](!w) (SSP).

Some thoughts:

- One approach is to write in a language whose set of features is the *intersection* of all the sets of features of output formats one is considering.
This way, for each thing one writes, there will be an equivalent in each of the output formats.

- Another approach is to take the *union* of the same sets of features.
This way, one has in a sense a "super language" that can deal with a lot more stuff.

Some promising tools:

- Pandoc (used for this site)
- [Madoko](https://www.madoko.net/)
