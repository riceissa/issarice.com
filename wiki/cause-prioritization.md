Since about the beginning of October 2014, I have been interested in cause prioritization.
In November 2014 I started the [Cause Prioritization Wiki](http://causeprioritization.org/), an informational site about cause prioritization.

My goal regarding cause prioritization is to first catalogue all of the promising causes people could work on---even those unknown by many---and to do research on each of these to find out how promising they are.
I want to build a community of researchers interested in finding out what the best causes are---and to do this research completely transparently.
The next step, of course, is to use this research to then actually work on the most promising causes, and to get others involved in these causes as well.
Here, too, I hope to build a community dedicated to discussing the cause.
