Since about the beginning of October 2014, I have been interested in **cause prioritization**, which aims to find the most effective causes people can work on.
In November 2014, I started the [Cause Prioritization Wiki](http://causeprioritization.org/), an informational site about cause prioritization.

My thoughts regarding cause prioritization are incipient; I [have some information on the wiki itself](http://causeprioritization.org/Goals%20of%20the%20wiki), but to summarize: at the moment I am trying to do a first-pass of all the promising causes people could work on (even those unknown by many) in order to find out which of them require a more urgent and thorough investigation.
I want to build a community of researchers who are [excited](http://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/20/excited-altruism/) about investigating what the best causes are---and to do this research completely transparently.
Eventually, of course, the plan is to use this research to actually work on the most promising causes, and to get others involved in these causes.
