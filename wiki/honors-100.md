This is my course review for [honors 100](https://depts.washington.edu/uwhonors/courses/honors100/) (Honors at the UW) at the University of Washington.
I took the course in autumn 2014 (taught by all three of the honors advisors, plus a "peer educator"---a non-first-year honors student who leads small-group discussions).
My classwork for the course is available under [my UW honors portfolio]() page.
I don't think the course was very important for my personal or intellectual growth.
