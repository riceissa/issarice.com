# Clarifying the terminology

As of Ubuntu 16.10, the default disk encryption method used when selecting
"Encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for security" during installation seems to
use dm-crypt with LUKS.
Here:

* **dm-crypt** is "is the standard device-mapper encryption functionality
  provided by the Linux kernel" ([ArchWiki][arch_de]).
* **LUKS** (Linux Unified Key Setup) is " an additional convenience layer which
  stores all of the needed setup information for dm-crypt on the disk itself
  and abstracts partition and key management in an attempt to improve ease of
  use and cryptographic security" ([ArchWiki][arch_de]).
* **cryptsetup** is the actual utility that you run as a user.

# Backing up the LUKS header

Check that the device is a LUKS device:

    $ sudo cryptsetup isLuks -v /dev/sda5
    Command successful.

Then [back up the header](https://www.gwern.net/Notes#november-2016-data-loss-postmortem):

    sudo cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup /dev/sda5 \
        --header-backup-file luks-header.bin.crypt
