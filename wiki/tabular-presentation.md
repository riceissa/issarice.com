Some thoughts on how best to represent information on tables.

- use grid lines or not?
- color alternation? -- cf. that one TeX SE question
- use lots of examples.
- markup syntax for tables: pandoc has many, but they're all unintuitive for me because they optimize for appearance in the markup, not the ease of entering in the data or how memorable the syntax is.
(In fact, I keep having to go to the Pandoc documentation to read up on how to make a table.)
Compare this to the Mediawiki markup, which is quite easy to remember, even though in the source markup it doesn't look like a table.
