i think more and more, its important to have online webpages that are
highly linkable. by this, i mean pages to which you can link, and the
other side can easily understand the content, so that it’s almost like
you’re explaining it to them in the chat or w/e. or that it’s really
shareable on fb statuses, makes a clear point, etc. in this sense, i
think gwern does poorly.
