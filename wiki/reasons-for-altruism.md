It occurs to me that there are many reasons (including many weird reasons) for altruism, so I'll try writing some of these down. For this page, I assume moral anti-realism. I'm pretty confused about the implications of various philosophical ideas so I'm likely to disagree with many of the points below in the future. (At the moment, I'm not even sure what I believe.)

- The typical reason seems to be that you value the welfare of others and the discount factor you apply for them (for not being you) isn't too low. So when making decisions, you take your own welfare into account, plus the aggregate (discounted) welfare of others.
- Worse case analysis: the worst that could happen from being too altruistic is that your own life could have been better. But how much better? If you already live a comfortable life, it seems doable but perhaps not straightforward or easy to live a much better life. On the other hand, the stakes of being too selfish seem quite high.
- Even if you discount the welfare of others to be arbitrarily low, as long as you have moral uncertainty and use something like the ["expected moral value"](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~mert2255/papers/mu-about-pe.pdf "Hilary Graves; Toby Ord. “Moral uncertainty about population axiology”.") approach, and there are sufficiently many other beings you could help, [swamping](https://causeprioritization.org/Swamping_(population_ethics)) could occur. This is because worldviews that subscribe to altruism think there is "more at stake" in the world.
- You could use a [Moral Parliament](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/moral-uncertainty-towards-a-solution.html "Nick Bostrom (January 1, 2009). “Moral uncertainty – towards a solution?” Overcoming Bias.") framework to make a ["veil of ignorance" or FDT-like deal](https://causeprioritization.org/Veil_of_ignorance_and_functional_decision_theory) in which in worlds where you can have a lot of impact, you act essentially like an altruist, whereas in worlds where you can't have much impact you act basically like a selfish person. And it appears that in this world we can have a lot of impact.[^bottleneck] (Actually, this sort of reasoning seems really tricky to me and I have no idea how to do it. For instance, you might update based on [cosmological information](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/BNbxueXEcm6dCkDuk/is-the-potential-astronomical-waste-in-our-universe-too) to stop caring about astronomical waste, which pushes in the selfishness direction. You could imagine taking into account more and more such trades. Where do you end up in the end, after "doing all the trades"? I have no idea.)
- Really weird veil of ignorance/ex-ante reasons. See e.g. ["On SETI"](https://sideways-view.com/2018/03/23/on-seti/): "The preceding analysis takes a cooperative stance towards aliens.  Whether that’s correct or not is a complicated question. It might be justified by either moral arguments (from behind the veil of ignorance we’re as likely to be them as us) or some weird thing with acausal trade (which I think is actually relatively likely)." ([Discussion](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/jhcwBXuNCWEsJdfKe/weird-question-could-we-see-distant-aliens/comment/o2YeveKZeG7LygfJF).) See also ["When is unaligned AI morally valuable?"](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/3kN79EuT27trGexsq/when-is-unaligned-ai-morally-valuable)
- If one of the Big World theories is correct, there could be many distant copies of you across the universe or multiverse. If you care about these copies, you might take actions to help them (e.g. acausal trades). Also, these actions may end up helping many others. So here you altruistically care about your copies, and non-altruistically help non-copies (see separate list below).
- A variant of the previous one is that even if the World is small, you might care about the pseudo-copies of you that other people create as they model your behavior. See [this post](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1ay/is_cryonics_necessary_writing_yourself_into_the/ "gworley (June 23, 2010). “Is cryonics necessary?: Writing yourself into the future”. LessWrong.") for a similar idea.
- You have many shared memories/experiences/decision algorithms/genes as many other people. If what you value about yourself is one of these things, you might care about the instances of these things even when they are in other people. Similarly you could take a ["pan-everythingism about everything"](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/files/Conversations/Brian_Tomasik_10-06-16_(public).pdf) approach, where many other things in the world *are* you to varying degrees. And presumably other humans are more like you than, say, rocks. You might also just be more confident about caring about preserving these kinds of intuitions, thought processes, patterns, memories, algorithms, or whatever, than about preserving your subjective experience.
  - This is apparently similar to Parfit's view on identity and egoism vs altruism, see e.g. the notes [here](http://www.oswego.edu/~delancey/471_DIR/471_LECTURES/ParfitPI.html): ‘Much of ethics is concerned with questions of egoism and altruism. Should I be concerned about myself alone, or others to some degree? But all of such considerations are based on assumptions of clear personal identity. If my future self is me only to some degree; if it has some psychological connectedness with my current self, but only to some degree; then it seems that egoism rests on a mistake. As a result, I should be attracted more towards accounts that weigh all interests equally, over those that tell me to weigh my interests alone or more heavily -- for after all, those future interests are "mine" only to some variable degree.’ (I haven't actually read Parfit.)
- You don't know how to be selfish or you think selfishness is incoherent.
  - From Stuart Armstrong's [ADT paper](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Anthropic_Decision_Theory_Tech_Report.pdf): "In the author’s view, the confusion illustrated by this section shows that selfishness is not a stable concept: those agents capable of changing their definitions of selfishness will be motivated to do so."
  - Paul Christiano, in a [post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QmWNbCRMgRBcMK6RK/the-absolute-self-selection-assumption) about UDASSA: "I don't understand continuity of experience or identity, so I am simply not going to try to be selfish (I don't know how)."
  - [Ozzie Gooen](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/MTpCeShqRmu4nkgon/critique-my-model-the-ev-of-agi-to-selfish-individuals "“Critique my Model: The EV of AGI to Selfish Individuals”. April 8, 2018. LessWrong."): "I personally find selfishness to be somewhat philosophically incoherent, so it’s difficult to say what exactly the maximum number of QALYS per year could hypothetically be experienced by one selfish person."

I'll also list some reasons why people may appear to behave altruistically
(i.e. will sometimes take actions which help others), even if they don't
terminally care about these people who are helped:[^real_altruism]

- Reducing x-risk is useful if you want to figure out your actual terminal
  values and you believe figuring this out is very difficult (e.g. it requires
  billions of years of reflection).
- Conscious or subconscious desire to appear altruistic, for instrumental
  reasons (like gaining status).
- Unreflective evolved adaptations that happen to help others (e.g. kin
  altruism, reciprocal altruism).
- Decision theoretic "categorial imperative"-type ideas, as suggested by Gary Drescher (in _Good and Real_) and others; see [this page](https://github.com/riceissa/issarice.com/blob/master/external/wiki.lesswrong.com/Application_of_functional_updateless_timeless_decision_theory_to_everyday_life.mediawiki) for more people who argue for the relevance of logical decision theories to everyday life. For example, using UDT-like reasoning in Newcomb-like situations or prisoner's dilemma with a copy can produce behavior that helps others.
- You want there to exist more smart/interesting/compassionate/good/whatever people for
  instrumental or aesthetic reasons.

I think one reason to pay attention to the variety of possible reasons for altruistic/cooperative behavior is that when you learn something new about the world, you can decide whether that changes how you should act, and the way you change how you act can depend on the kind of altruism you have. For example, if you find out a way in which being selfish is coherent (when you previously thought it was incoherent), that can give you a reason to act more selfishly if the incoherence was one of the main reasons you were being altruistic, whereas if you just cared about the well-being of others you wouldn't really change how you act.

More quotes (to be added to the right place later):

Abram Demski <https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/h9qQQA3g8dwq6RRTo/counterfactual-mugging-why-should-you-pay/answer/iFcnSYrvsp7Xn2WrN>:

- "One way of appealing to human moral intuition (which I think is not vacuous) is to say, what if you know that someone is willing to risk great harm to save your life _because they trust you the same_, and you find yourself in a situation where you can sacrifice your own hand to prevent a fatal injury from happening to them? _It’s a good deal_; it could have been your life on the line."
- "Reciprocal altruism and true altruism are kind of hard to distinguish in human psychology, but I said “it’s a good deal” to point at the reciprocal-altruism intuition. The point being that acts of reciprocal altruism can be a good deal w/o having considered them ahead of time. It’s perfectly possible to reason “it’s a good deal to lose my hand in this situation, because I’m trading it for getting my life saved in a different situation; one which hasn’t come about, but could have.”"

    > What strikes me about our current situation is not only are we at an extremely influential point in the history of the universe, but how few people realize this. It ought to give the few people in the know enormous power (relative to just about anyone else who has existed or will exist) to affect the future, but, even among those who do realize that we're at a bottleneck, few try to shape the future in any substantial way, to nudge it one way or another. Instead, they just go about their "normal" lives, and continue to spend their money on the standard status symbols and consumer goods.

[^real_altruism]: It's not entirely clear to me whether there is a fundamental difference between "caring about someone intrinsically/as a terminal value" vs "caring about someone instrumentally/for cooperation" (I think there are operationalizations one can choose that would make them different, e.g. you could observe whether someone continues to behave altruistically if it became obvious that the other side couldn't pay back). Looking at the causal history, it seems like the former arose because the latter happened to work well, and it seems like "baking in" the values as terminal values was a particularly effective implementation of getting the cooperation to work (or something like that).


When most people say "I am selfish", they mean something like "the
things that happen to this physical instantiation of this algorithm,
over the next 50 years or so". That worked well in the ancestral
environment, but under no principled understanding of the world and
how identity works does that make sense. So I think selfish people
have a lot of work to do, if they don't want to suck at being selfish.
