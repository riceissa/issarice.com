- the connection between hiring people for a job and judging the
  character of people fascinates me (e.g. for finding good friends, or
  for romantic relationships).
- both are clearly important: you need to hire people to get tasks done,
  and you want to find good friends/partner(s)
- both can take quite a bit of commitment to accurately judge
- both can end disastrously (due diligence)
- in both scenarios, there can be multiple people doing the judging, so
  there can be some gossip among those "in the know"
- sometimes it can be *really hard* to tell the difference between
  someone who is an *extremely* good fit, and someone who is a terrible
  fit.

        Similarly, stalking someone's friends might be useful if you
        want to determine their character.

        Similar is a [post by Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10154648023319228):

        Also interesting is the IQ gap reported in leader--follower
        relationships.

        From [*Handbook of Organizational and Managerial
        Wisdom*][handbook_wisdom] (p 310):

        > The modest relationship of leadership and intelligence may occur
        > because it might not be intelligence per se that matters in
        > leadership; instead, it might be the relative intelligence of leaders

- GiveWell has [The process of hiring our first cause-specific Program Officer](http://blog.givewell.org/2015/09/03/the-process-of-hiring-our-first-cause-specific-program-officer/).
Talking about senior hiring, they list some general principles:

    > -   The best way to evaluate someone is to work with them. The ideal way
    >     to make a senior hire would be to have a longstanding relationship
    >     with someone, perhaps as a part-time consulting arrangement.
    > -   Interviews are highly unreliable. The evaluation process should be
    >     designed as much as possible to mimic working together.
    > -   References are extremely important, and it can be useful to talk to
    >     many people about the candidate (including people who weren’t
    >     specifically offered as references).

    Also:

    > When a candidate didn’t mention a major aspect of the criminal

    > were omitting it because they (a) had strong knowledge of it and
    > were making a considered decision to de-prioritize this aspect of
    > the field; (b) didn’t have much experience or knowledge of this
    > area of the field.

    (So the general lesson here might be "do your homework" before trying to hire people.)

Something I find unfortunate is that most people require an overwhelming amount of evidence before recognizing someone's greatness. The more time one has to think and the more one interacts with someone (or just reads their content), the easier it is to tell their greatness. But it seems like someone people have the skill/ability to recognize greatness given a very small amount of evidence. The rest of humanity requires such an overwhelming amount of evidence of greatness that it becomes impossible to ignore it (and such evidence often only becomes available once the person in question has died). (See Eliezer Yudkowsky's posts about Solomonoff induction and the difference between science and rationality for related ideas. "I sometimes say that the goal of science is to amass such an enormous mountain of evidence that not even scientists can ignore it" ([source](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WijMw9WkcafmCFgj4/do-scientists-already-know-this-stuff)).)

On false positives and false negatives:
if people are very careful to only "approve" of people who are very similar to themselves or have concrete accomplishments, there will be lots of false negatives but few false positives.
If people can be tricked by confidence/credentials/social status given to a person by others, then we can expect lots of false positives.
I think many "great minds" are great in somewhat unique ways, which makes it pretty hard to detect their greatness (if one is using some sort of similarity metric to judge how great someone is).
Here's like a worst-case scenario in terms of judging someone: the person is great in a really important but difficult-to-detect way, they don't like to accumulate credentials, they haven't been detected by other people (so there's no social status floating around), they don't signal confidence, and they aren't similar to other great people who have been discovered so far. The chance of a random person being like this is very low, but I do wonder how many people like this we miss out on because our judgment mechanisms aren't good enough (i.e. have too many false negatives).

Eliezer once left a comment on one of Scott Sumner's posts about how he
(Eliezer) was able to identify Sumner as a "correct contrarian", despite at
first not having much subject knowledge. It was something about the rhythm of
the debate and the kinds of rhetoric Sumner used.
