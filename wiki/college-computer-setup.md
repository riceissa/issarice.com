# First year

Over the course of my first year at [[University of Washington]], my computer setup changed a few times, so I thought I'd talk about them here (since it might help others decide on how to approach their own college computer setup).

Before college, I didn't have a fast laptop computer; my main machine actually was an Acer laptop but its screen was broken so in order to use it I had to connect it to an external monitor! I didn't want to take this machine to my dorm room because I knew it would be a pain to setup, and also I still wanted a computer to use at home.

I didn't get a laptop for college at first (unlike many of my peers). My reasoning was that laptops are easily stolen, and I didn't expect to do any "real" work outside my dorm room: I can still program in my room, and I have my phone with me all the time to read things on, so why would I spend several hundred dollars on a new laptop?

So I decided to build a desktop for my dorm room, and keep my "laptop" with the broken screen at home.
You might think a desktop would be more expensive, but because a friend had some extra parts for most of the machine, and was willing to basically give it away to me, I was able to get the desktop for around $60.
Since I already had an extra monitor, keyboard, and mouse, this was a pretty cheap and good deal.

Due to some complications with building the machine though^[A defective motherboard and optical drive.], actually bringing the computer to my dorm was delayed several weeks(?).^[
    A little before courses had started, but after I had already moved into my dorm, I actually remember asking a question on Quora about how to get a Haskell compiler for the UW library computers.
]
So for the first few weeks (?) I didn't really have a computer in college (this wasn't *really* a problem though, in terms of doing coursework: most of the homework was due each week so I could just e.g. do math problems on paper and LaTeX them over the weekend).

Later, I had begun working with a friend in a UW library each week to do some extra CS learning.
This, of course, required having a device on which I could program that was portable.
No problem, I decided to buy a Google Nexus 7 tablet, and then connect to a Linode machine in the cloud that had everything already setup.
I could even buy a Bluetooth keyboard because Vim on a touchscreen didn't sound like fun.
Well, this worked for a while, except the Bluetooth keyboard wasn't that great to type on, and *constantly* depending on WiFi to connect to Linode wasn't that great either (although UW does provide WiFi everywhere).
This setup, where I would take the tablet and phone around during the day and then work on my desktop in my dorm room, lasted for most of the year.
Part of why I didn't change earlier was that most classes continued to not really require a laptop; we never programmed in class or anything and all I needed was a browser, which the tablet adequately supplied.
Even when studying with my friend, a lot of the time we'd just be reading and doing problems on paper, so being able to program wasn't *that* important.

In spring quarter though, I finally got a Thinkpad x220^[Two friends independently suggested I get this machine!], which was great timing because having an actual mobile machine to program on was important for [[ATM S 559]].

# Second year at UW

I've gotten really used to having a laptop to take around
with me everywhere.
I actually often just keep the Thinkpad in my backpack even when I don't
necessarily use it in class (it noticeably makes my backpack heavier though).
This year, being able to program outside of my dorm room has been more
important: CSE 332 has partner programming projects, so being able to work in
a public space is useful.
In addition, math 33X this year has had a lot more opportunities to work with
classmates on problem sets, and since I typeset most of my homework with
LaTeX, it's useful to be able to solve a problem and then type it up all while
working with people in a library.

I actually like my Thinkpad so much now that I just use it at home as well; I
just take it back each weekend.
At home I hook it up to an external monitor and enjoy a dual-screen setup.
