Over the course of my first year at [University of Washington](), my computer setup changed a few times, so I thought I'd talk about them here (since it might help others decide on how to approach their own college computer setup).

Before college, I didn't have a fast laptop computer; my main machine actually was an Acer laptop but its screen was broken so in order to use it I had to connect it to an external monitor! I didn't want to take this machine to my dorm room because I knew it would be a pain to setup, and also I still wanted a computer to use at home.

I didn't get a laptop for college at first (unlike many of my peers). My reasoning was that laptops are easily stolen, and I didn't expect to do any "real" work outside my dorm room: I can still program in my room, and I have my phone with me all the time to read things on, so why would I spend several hundred dollars on a new laptop?

So I decided to build a desktop for my dorm room, and keep my "laptop" with the broken screen at home.
You might think a desktop would be more expensive, but because a friend had some extra parts for most of the machine, and was willing to basically give it away to me, I was able to get the desktop for around $60.
Since I already had an extra monitor, keyboard, and mouse, this was a pretty cheap and good deal.

Due to some complications with building the machine though^[A defective motherboard and optical drive.], actually bringing the computer to my dorm was delayed several weeks(?).^[
    A little before courses had started, but after I had already moved into my dorm, I actually remember asking a question on Quora about how to get a Haskell computer for the UW library computers.

So for the first few weeks (?) I didn't really have a computer in college (this wasn't *really* a problem though, in terms of doing coursework: most of the homework was due each week so I could just e.g. do math problems on paper and LaTeX them over the weekend).

Later, I had begun working with a friend in a UW library each week to do some extra CS learning.
This, of course,
