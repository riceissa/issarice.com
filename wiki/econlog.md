Although I don't really pay attention to politics or know much about economics, I still like [EconLog](http://econlog.econlib.org/) a lot, especially the [posts on there by Bryan Caplan](http://econlog.econlib.org/authorbcaplan.html).
Here I'll maintain a list of posts I really like on the blog[^also].
Note that I don't necessarily agree with what's said in the posts below.
