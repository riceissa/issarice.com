This is my course review for physics 121 at University of Washington. I
took the course in spring 2015 under [Jim Reid] (lecturer).  The lab
instructor was [Jens Gundlach] (though I never once saw him, since TAs
lead the lab section).

Overall, this course marks my worst experience in a UW course so far,
and was easily worse than even high school IB physics (which I took for
two years).  The sheer paternalism of the course is incredible: there
are six deadlines per week, as well as mandatory attendance to five
locations per week.  The instructor also doesn't do a good job
explaining the structure of the course, so the first week I was highly
confused.  When I finally understood the structure of the course, I was
in disbelief.  Indeed, a table that one of my tutorial TAs drew helped
me understand the components of the course.

- Lecture
    - Prelecture on Smartphysics (video slides and questions)
    - Lecture itself (mandatory attendance through clickers)
    - Homework (Webassign)
- Tutorial
    - Pretutorial (15 minute questions)
    - Tutorial (working through a workbook with peers at a table)
    - Tutorial homework (working through the homework workbook, which is
      very similar to the tutorial workbook)
- Lab
    - Prelab (questions on webassign)
    - Lab itself (working with a partner through the lab notebook)
    - Postlab (questions and manual data entry, calculations, etc.)

 The course has a shocking *nine* components.  Most
courses have lecture, quiz section, and homework---three components.  I
actually didn't understand the course structure for the first two
weeks---it might be even more complicated than the material of the
course---until a TA drew a grid with all the components.  Essentially,
each of the three "locations" (lecture, tutorial, lab) have a pre- in-
and post- component.  So pre-lecture, the actual lecture, and the
post-lecture (regular homework).  Then there's pre-tutorial, the actual
tutorial, and the post-tutorial (tutorial homework).  *Then* there's
pre-lab, the actual lab, and the post-lab. Plus three midterms and a
final.  In comparison, my math course has lecture, a quiz once a week,
and homework once a week. Two midterms and a final.

On top of this, attendance to lectures is practically mandatory seeing
that they take attendance randomly using clicker questions.  In CS
lecture the last two quarters, Friday lectures were noticeably less
crowded because attendance wasn't required, and I'm guessing people got
lazy.  I mean, if you want incentivize people to attend lecture just to
push a few buttons and collect points for that day, then okay.  But
don't expect people to learn any better for it.  Case in point: the mean
on the first midterm was a 61 out of 100.  What' shocking is that there
has to be people who scored *below* the mean...

I'm also bitter about the course because it's at the physics building
(the building that is literally the farthest away from north campus
dorms) and lecture is at 8:30 in the morning.

The webassign style of homework is also much less forgiving. Although
you get maybe 10 tries for each problem, if you get even a little bit
wrong (it has maybe a 1% tolerance for answers), it will just give you a
small hint an no other help.  Contrast this to high school: once you do
the problem, sure you might not get immediate feedback (though often the
teacher gave a problem whose answer was in the back of the textbook),
but if you really can't do it, you could just *stop working on it* and
ask questions the next day, when the homework problems were covered in
class.  Sure, this was tedious, but is it not better than not ever
knowing the answer?

The tolerance of the lab webassign questions are similarly barbaric.  If
your significant figures are off by more than one, it will refuse to
accept your answer, even in part.  And it gives no indication of where
you might have messed up in the long trail of tedious calculations.

Tutorial: the latter ones did prove helpful in solidifying some
concepts, but having to actually write everything down in the book is
very tedious. This was the least bad portion of the course.

The midterms: being crowded in a room in Kane with desks that can't even
fit the midterm... During my second midterm I had to sit next to someone
who smelled of cigarettes... 

The prospect of attending lecture at 8:30 in the morning just for a few
clicker questions that may not even happen... was so discouraging that I
began skipping several lectures toward the end of the course.

The smartphysics: at first I thought I might evade the hefty fee by just
doing every prelecture in the one month trial period, and get it out of
the way. Unfortunatley, they don't even give you access to the
prelecture until a few days before the corresponding lecture takes
place, so you're forced to pay the fee and go along with the pace of the
course...

The performance of the other students in the course was also worrying.
(the midterms of the course, for instance, were 61 and 53 (std 18)).
Moreover people seem to take notes even for extremely basic things. Case
in point: the first lecture was about reasoning with dimensional
analysis (the rudiments of it, anyway), and the people around me were
furiously writing down notes, as if they had never seen this stuff.
