I have been active on the question-and-answer site [Quora](https://quora.com) since February 2014.
I mostly like trying to ask interesting questions; I have asked over 3,100 questions as of August 2015.^[I think question-askers
are often ignored because once a good answer to a question is produced,
the answer is what gets attention, not the question that led to the
answer.]
For my most recent questions, see [my questions page on
Quora][my qs].

I also have about 80 answers on the site as of August 2015, some of which are archived on this site at [[My Quora answers]].

I think Quora has the potential to produce long-lasting content, but [similarly to Vipul Naik, I am uncertain of the social value of contributing](http://vipulnaik.com/quora/)[^vipul].

[^vipul]: Quoting Vipul Naik:

    > The social value of writing questions and answers on Quora remains unclear to me. However, I do intend to write questions and answers on Quora to the extent that it also meets some other goals of mine (such as helping me learn something I want to know, or helping other people learn something specific that I consider important).

Here is a screenshot of my Quora stats page for my all-time questions (starting in early 2014 and going until 2015-10-20):
