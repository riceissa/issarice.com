I've been interested in commenting systems, comment [spam in blogs](!w), and whether it's a good idea to have comments on this site.
I [once asked on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/riceissa/posts/1477764832502469):

> What are the advantages and disadvantages of the various commenting

It's rather interesting how many different commenting systems one can find, and is natural to ask which one works best.
And if that is an ill-defined question, then one can at least try to ask what one should use on one's own website.

It might be worthwhile to list all the possible parameters (i.e. to
extend the list I came up with in the Facebook post).

- Nesting/threading: [Web Discussions: Flat by Design](http://blog.codinghorror.com/web-discussions-flat-by-design/)
- Unit of language relevant for replies
    - talk about [Comment Press](http://futureofthebook.org/commentpress/)
    - Medium also has paragraph-level comments
- Voting
- Location of downvoted content. John_Maxwell_IV [writes][lw jm]:

    > On reddit, if your submission is downvoted, it's downvoted in to
    > obscurity. On Less Wrong, downvoted posts remain on the Discussion
    > page, creating a sort of public humiliation for people who are
    > downvoted.

    [lw jm]: http://lesswrong.com/lw/mbd/lesswrong_effective_altruism_forum_and_slate_star/cghw

    This is also true of a site like Quora, where heavily downvoted
    answers are hidden.

- User accounts
    - Anonymity/pseudonymity
- Markup language
- Permissions (e.g. ability to edit others' comments)
    - Version control (though I've never seen this before)
- Timestamp
- Quotation (as on bulletin boards); see [Web Discussions: Flat by Design](http://blog.codinghorror.com/web-discussions-flat-by-design/) again.
- Independence (i.e., each comment to a post could become a post itself, to which others could comment)

Some questions to ask:

- Can a greedy selection (in the sense that, for each bullet point, one
  chooses the most preferable option) of the features optimize for the
  "best" commenting system?
- What patterns might we find if we classify many of the existing
  commenting systems (e.g. on Facebook, Quora, Wikipedia discussions,
  reddit, WordPress, Disqus, Discourse, etc.)?


# Comments for personal sites

## Cons

On social media like Facebook and Quora, and even on WordPress blogs, it
is not necessary to think too much on commenting, since this is all
provided upstream.  When I first started using a static site generator
to make my website, I followed gwern and used [Disqus](!w).  However,
currently this site has no comments.  My reasoning is that, ever since
I've become active on Facebook, I've realized that most of the useful
discussions about an article happen there, instead of on the original
article's comments section.  More directly, in his answer to "[Why are
people more willing to comment on a Facebook post sharing an article
rather than in the comments section of the article itself?][andrew]",
Andrew Ho writes:

This obviously does not happen on every site.  In fact, I get the
impression that small personal sites tend to have the highest-quality
comments, while large news sites tend to have the worst, with blogs
somewhere in the middle.

The other issue is with having to moderate the comments.  Quora and
Facebook are convenient because they require real names, and thus are
able to keep out non-human spam (for the most part).  Disqus does seem
to have anti-spam measures, but verifying the identities of commenters
may be more difficult since people can choose to post anonymously (and
also because Disqus isn't as widely-used as Facebook).

It's probably worth thinking about why we have comments in the first
place.  Comments are useful chiefly because they are a means to provide
feedback for the author.  But this can be done via email or messaging
(see my [contact information](about-me#contact) for how); better yet,
for minor things like pointing out typos, I have an "edit page" link at
the top of each page that will allow people with GitHub accounts to fork
the site repo and submit a pull request.

There is also the problem of security.  Since it's not possible to
support native comments using purely static HTML, one must rely on
something like PHP or Javascript.  PHP can be [unsafe to use][php sec],
and relying on some external Javascript like Disqus means that it won't
work for people with Javascript disabled and comments might suddenly
disappear (if Disqus goes away).

[php sec]: http://www.networkworld.com/article/2345518/data-center/firewall-pioneer-wanted-a--super-secure--blogging-service-----so-he-s-built-his-own.html

Another idea: having comments could mean more flame.
When people on a site see that others are complaining about something, they might jump on that and add more flame^[I wouldn't compare this site to [Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/), but just look at any post there to see the problem of unending arguments.].
(This, of course, relates to the problem of the burden of moderation.)
Even seemingly innocuous content on an otherwise unknown site could become the target of a torrent of verbal attacks, and dealing with this seems highly stressful.
Forcing people to email in their attacks could have a dampening effect.
Of course, this doesn't prevent public attacks happening on Twitter, Tumblr, and elsewhere.

## Pros

One idea in favor of having comments is so criticisms are out in the
open.  But there are other ways to do this[^otherways], and in any case,
how can one trust a site owner to be honest about the comments posted on
their own site (since they usually have the power to delete any comment,
or even edit them in the case of sites using WordPress)?

[^otherways]: gwern has an "[External
links](http://www.gwern.net/On%20Stress#external-links)" section for his
page *On Stress* that links to a reddit discussion of the page.  I can
do the same with Facebook discussions or when I crosspost to Quora.


Another idea is that there is a natural presumption that commenting on a
site is enabled.  This site itself is the most natural place to have a
discussion about the content on the site, and also provides an obvious
place for readers to interact with each other; who am I to take this
zone of exchange away?


Some convincing ideas for me are:

- Site-native comments are potentially easier to backup than comments
  posted to Facebook or Quora.  Even Disqus does not allow the site
  owner to backup the comments for a site (only their own comments, last
  time I checked); [gwern seems to backup Disqus comments
  though](http://www.gwern.net/Archiving%20URLs#comment-886147303)[^disquscomments].

[^disquscomments]: In response to "What about [archiving] the comments
here?", gwern writes:

    > Likely to die, I'm afraid. I do back up my Disqus comments on a
    > regular basis, but there's no guarantee that I'll migrate them to
    > the next commenting system. (On the plus side, I try to address
    > any issues comments bring up, quote ones which add to the article,
    > etc, so the losses won't be too great.)

- Some people don't have an account on Facebook or Quora, and even
  emailing may be inconvenient.  For this, I do have an [anonymous
  feedback form][feedback] (which works even with text-only browsers
  like Elinks), as advertised on my contacts section of the about page.

[feedback]: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AbwmuMIyzB5X7P4ysL71vGD4WnMxsCKsAZULLc0X7V0/viewform?usp=send_form

- Having a comments section might be a good idea for an outsider (say,
  if they want to recruit bloggers).  Vipul Naik writes in [his answer
  to "How do you recruit writers for a group blog?"][recruit] that he
  searched on Bryan Caplan's EconLog when looking for bloggers to
  recruit to Open Borders:

    [recruit]: https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-recruit-writers-for-a-group-blog/answer/Vipul-Naik

I also do have a GitHub repository for this site, where anyone can open
an issue, which is viewable publicly.

    This is related to my idea of treating comments as their own post.

    However, with this, it's important to consider the counterfactual:
    by removing a place to rapidly provide thoughts, readers may *never*
    end up providing their thoughts. In other words, I suspect that for
    many, it's comments or nothing; making one's own site or blog
    isn't an option (too much activation energy required).
