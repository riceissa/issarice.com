Some notes about something that I'm not sure what to call.
It might be (non-self-propagating or self-defeating or non-self-reinforcing)
(ideologies or values or movements).
The basic idea is that (at least naively) following through on the idea results
in the idea being spread less, so that there is a negative feedback loop.
This is mainly because these values go against goals that show up in
[instrumental convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence).

As [Brian Tomasik notes](http://reducing-suffering.org/strategic-considerations-moral-antinatalists/#Will_voluntary_antinatalism_work)
for antinatalism:

> antinatalist efforts like those of VHEMT will not work on a population level.
> Antinatalism is far too fringe for most people to accept it. Biological
> drives to reproduce are too powerful for ethical arguments to win out. And
> even if 99% of the human population were somehow convinced of antinatalism,
> the other 1% would continue reproducing and would spread its genes and
> worldview to the next generation.
