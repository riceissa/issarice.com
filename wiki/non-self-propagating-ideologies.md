Some notes about something that I'm not sure what to call.
It might be (non-self-propagating or self-defeating or non-self-reinforcing)
(ideologies or values or movements).
The basic idea is that (at least naively) following through on the idea results
in the idea being spread less, so that there is a negative feedback loop.
This is mainly because these values go against goals that show up in
[instrumental convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence).

For instance, a person whose values are against resource acquisition will have
a difficult time trying to spread this value to others, because spreading the
value involves acquiring more resources in order to gain converts and so forth.
This person would have to -- going against their values -- gain more resources
first, and then somehow use those resources to spread their value of not
gaining more resources.

As [Brian Tomasik notes](http://reducing-suffering.org/strategic-considerations-moral-antinatalists/#Will_voluntary_antinatalism_work)
for antinatalism:

> antinatalist efforts like those of VHEMT will not work on a population level.
> Antinatalism is far too fringe for most people to accept it. Biological
> drives to reproduce are too powerful for ethical arguments to win out. And
> even if 99% of the human population were somehow convinced of antinatalism,
> the other 1% would continue reproducing and would spread its genes and
> worldview to the next generation.

Another example of this, I think, is when people oppose various dominant
institutions of the world.
For instance, one might oppose the publish-or-perish mentality in academia, but
in order to push one's values on the system, one might want to gain some amount
of influence in academia first by publishing papers.
(There are probably easier ways to act against this.)
