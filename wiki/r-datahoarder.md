I decided to spend some time looking through /r/DataHoarder, a subreddit.
I did this as part of my interest in [digital preservation]().

Looking through the [top posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/top/?sort=top&t=all),
I noticed that most of them were about people showing off the arrivals
of their new high-capacity storage drives.
There are also some posts that show off people's specs through a software
dashboard.
I wasn't too interested in this, but this seems to by typical of reddit,
where simple feel-good posts get the highest scores.
