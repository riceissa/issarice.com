This is my course review for English 131 (Composition: Exposition) at the University of Washington.
I took the course in autumn 2014 with Tyler Kipling.

I don't have much to say about this course---it reminded me of junior high and high school English, except it was quite a bit easier than my high school IB English class due to the lack of pressure.

I tried my best to twist some of the essay topics around so I could end up researching/writing about things that would be useful in the long run (e.g. I wrote about the diversity in Quora for one of my papers).
(I should try uploading my papers at some point---no rush though.)

What annoyed me was that the grading for the course was so mysterious; I asked the instructor multiple times during the course about expected grades or percentages, but only got responses like "you're doing well; don't worry about it".
