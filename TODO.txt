NEW:

- go through generator.py, metadata.py, and commands.py (and maybe also
  tag_ontology.py) to document code.
- use classes instead of purely procedural stuff (do this slowly)
- make links all relative (so they work locally, and on servers even
  when the pages aren't hosted in the root dir)
- efficiency?? -- right now, it takes about 9 seconds to process all
  files, while hakyll takes about 6 (+4 for compiling site.hs). But
  generator.py does a lot more tag processing, so maybe speed isn't
  really a concern.
- actually publish to riceissa.com at some point..

OLD:

- figure out why LaTeX code blocks aren't highlighting
- add update dates to bottom or top of each page
- verify that mathjax works -- also make sure the mathjax javascript
  isn't loaded on pages that don't require math
- import remaining pages from github pages site. & add more notes files.
- decide what to do about image/pdf hosting (just outsource? .. to WP or
  flickr)
- on tags, show the number of items in each tag in parentheses
