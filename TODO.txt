- figure out why LaTeX code blocks aren't highlighting
- fix tags so that pages without tags don't have the "tags: " thing at the end
- add update dates to bottom or top of each page
- clean up site.hs
- verify that mathjax works -- also make sure the mathjax javascript isn't loaded on pages that don't require math
- make a page that lists all the tags.
- import remaining pages from github pages site. & add more notes files.
- decide what to do about image/pdf hosting (just outsource? .. to WP or flickr)
- make sure to credit people on site.hs
- write a page that has all the instructions for setting up hakyll (so that no one has to go through all the searching that I went through)
- on tags, show the number of items in each tag in parentheses
- figure out how to sort pages on /all using the alphabetic ordering of the title, not the URI
