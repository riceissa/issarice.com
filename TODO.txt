Possible list of things to write about:

- wordpress
- EA & EA links (make separate pages)
- high school
- peter thiel, elon musk, travis kalanick, jeff bezos, mark zuckerberg
- bertrand russell
- dating and relationships
- the value of books
- how to write
- gender (evo bio)
- feminism (logical argument)
- nice guys
- race
- libertarianism
- communism (Marxians)
- neoreactionaries
- Freud
- the difference between "knowing about a topic" and "knowing what experts/the mainstream think about a topic"
- Japanese literature
    - oe kenzaburo (UC Berkeley lecture on A Personal Matter by John Wallace(?))

NEW:

- write a redirect feature like https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from .
    - more generally, write a "plugin feature" so it's easier to add things later.
- go through generator.py, metadata.py, and commands.py (and maybe also
  tag_ontology.py) to document code.
- use classes instead of purely procedural stuff (do this slowly)

- efficiency?? -- right now, it takes about 30 seconds to process all
  files. It used to be that generator.py took 9 seconds while hakyll
  took about 6 (+4 for compiling site.hs). But generator.py does a lot
  more tag processing, so maybe speed isn't really a concern. Now
  generator.py makes a sitemap as well.  30 *is* slow, but the --files
  flag allows for partial compilation (something I didn't see in Jekyll
  or Hakyll), which means I can quickly check the output of the file I
  am editing.  I do want to work on this though to make it run faster.

- fix slugification method... (right now i think it fails for japanese characters, for example, as well as accented latin characters. also consider switching to wikipedia-style Cool URIs.)

OLD:

- figure out why LaTeX code blocks aren't highlighting
- import remaining pages from github pages site. & add more notes files.
- decide what to do about image/pdf hosting (just outsource? .. to WP or
  flickr)
- on tags, show the number of items in each tag in parentheses
