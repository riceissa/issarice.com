NEW:

- make side bar responsive: as gwern notes, there are TWO kinds of
  navigational information. one is site-specific, so home, about, feed,
  comment, and website source. the other is page-specific, so the table
  of contents, permalink to page, and page source. the site-specific
  things can stay at the top (where it has always been), but having the
  TOC and other page-specific stuff in the same place or in the page is
  less useful. it's hard to find things in the page and easy to get lost
  from the overall structure of the page when there are many headings.
  one way is to make each page small and manageable, but as someone who
  suffers from low working memory, shouldn't i be helping my readers by
  always presenting the overall structure of the page to the side? I
  like the design in
  <http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/essential_compilers.html>, but
  unfortunately that page displays the *global* (i.e. site-specific)
  stuff on the side, not page-specific stuff. By the same author:
  <http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/>, which is much nicer (this one is
  more fancy, and actually expands subsections as the user scrolls; I
  don't need this. However, one annoying bug is that if the TOC is too
  long, the user can't even see the whole TOC! There has *got* to be
  something better (hmm actually on further experimentation, it appears
  that something as simple as `overflow: auto` fixes the problem.
  great!)). Also some browsers like elinks and firefox with vimfx can
  easily go to the top/bottom of pages, but i have to remember that most
  people aren't as obsessed about customizing browsers, so it would be
  good to have an easier way to navigate a page.

    The sidebar should also be responsive, in that when the width
    becomes too small, the display "squishes" into the original (i.e.
    current) form.

    One thing to consider: could people find this annoying to browse? I
    personally dislike mobile sites that try to show the navigation bar
    when i scroll up, since it often activates when i don't intend it to
    (so there could be an analogy here, where a user doesn't expect the
    sidebar to stick, and gets annoyed when it doesn't behave like they
    expect it to). also mobile readers probably lack attention span
    more: but which direction should this make us update in? should we
    say "give them what they want, by showing them more things to click
    on"? or "give them the overall structure so they know where they are
    since they are forgetful"? or "give them a clean column of text
    without distractions and maybe we can keep them here longer"?

    this is a distinction gwern recently made as well, though i think
    his solution is suboptimal (since the TOC doesn't stick).

    something like the following works, after some quick hacking. of
    course, more adjustments will become necessary. note that this is a
    completely javascript-free solution.

    ```
    @media (min-width: 48em) {
        div#TOC {
            position: fixed;
            left: 0;
            top: 10px;
            bottom: 0;
            overflow: auto;
        }

        h2#TOCheading {
            border-bottom: none;
        }
    }
    ```

    NEW VERSION (works with site after switching to just pandoc and makefile; note, you must surround the content div with a content_container div):

    ```
    @media (min-width: 50em) {
        nav#TOC {
            position: fixed;
            left: 0;
            top: 4ex;
            bottom: 0;
            overflow: auto;
            width: 15em;
            display: block;
        }

        h2#TOCheading {
            border-bottom: none;
        }

        div#content_container {
            padding-left: 15em;
        }
    }
    ```

- make mathjax the default math display if javascript is available, but
  *somehow* detect and switch to image-based math (like wikipedia's
  default) when javascript isn't available. moreover, somehow just show
  the raw LaTeX in an unobtrusive way when the user is on a text-only
  browser.

- doing `import html` or `from html import escape` breaks the compilation process at the step of applying the pandoc filter (see commit `ef8e9b9d1a534150a7146f680a3778eab6f26a6b`)
- decide what to do about the problem of adding multiple languages/other parameters.
  right now the structure is flat, i.e. everything comes after issarice.com/ . But what if we have another language, and want to have pagename1 for both languages (maybe they are even the exact same word in each language).
  One solution is subdomains, but this is a bit tricky if one wants to have a locally-generated site. We could also do something like issarice.com/wiki/en/pagename1 for the english page, but then this breaks compatibility with what already exists. One solution is to have all the main pages flat (which are english for the time being), but then have a few "blacklisted" pages that cannot be created. This is already the case with "tags", "images" (though this one isn't really true, since images are added to the flat issarice.com/ ), "static".
  We could then add to this blacklist e.g. single alpha characters a..z, which we can use for further things.
  Like 'c' could stand for "content", so we could then just have issarice.com/c/wiki/en/pagename1, for instance. Then still the most obvious place to go (which is issarice.com/pagename1) will work, while the more "logical" placement will also work.

OLD:

- figure out why LaTeX code blocks aren't highlighting; i think this is just because pandoc only highlights comments for LaTeX, for some reason
- import remaining pages from github pages site. & add more notes files.
- on tags, show the number of items in each tag in parentheses
