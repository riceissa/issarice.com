- second line of .md must begin with "title: " followed by the title name,
  optionally in double quotes
- md file name should not contain an underscore (since underscores have special
  meaning, used for _archive) -- use hyphens instead to separate words. For
  the exact algorithm used to convert page titles into page paths, see the slug
  script: https://github.com/riceissa/dotfiles/blob/master/.local/bin/slug
- md filename should not contain a period (since images and sitemaps have
  periods)
- double quotes must not be in the title (use unicode if quoting is needed)
- ampersand ("&") must not be in the title (use "and" instead)
- left and right angle brackets must not be in title ("<" and ">"); there
  should not be a need for this in the title. This is for og:title.
- md pages must be in the directory wiki/ as a flat structure
- md files must have the extension ".md"
- use "date:" in YYYY-MM-DD format to specify the date of last substantive
  revision
- use "created:" in YYYY-MM-DD format to specify the creation date
- use "author:" to specify author
- The first "date:" at the beginning of a line in a markdown page must specify
  the date. In practice, this means one should always specify "date:" on the
  third or fourth line.
