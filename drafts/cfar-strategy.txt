Consider the following argument for what CFAR is doing:

1. Humans currently fall far short in rationality than what can potentially be achieved (https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/Nu3wa6npK4Ry66vFp/a-sense-that-more-is-possible)

2. Several of the rudiments of teaching rationality are known

3. These rationality techniques are teachable in an intense 4-day workshop (plus a small number of Skype sessions and interactions with other alumni of the workshops, and whatever else CFAR offers)

4. Once these rudimentary rationality techniques are mastered, people are in fact much more rational in a way we care about.

(I'm only considering here the "teach people rationality" aspect of CFAR. CFAR is probably also functioning as a "get people to care more about important cause areas" and "be a place that attracts smart people" organization.)
