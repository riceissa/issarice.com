I've been wondering some lately about what the world would look like
if the competent use of spaced repetition software was as commonplace
as something mundane like high school algebra. For the purposes of
this thought experiment, I'm not increasing the general sanity of
people or civilization (so e.g. people won't magically start
memorizing important things). They would just have "virtuoso skill"
(as Michael Nielsen would say) at using spaced repetition software.

Some ideas:

* Reputations have the potential to be more solid and precise. Someone
  who made a thoughtful comment on a blog post could rely on it being
  remembered far into the future. Someone who flouted a social norm
  wouldn't just be remembered as "weird" but would actually have the
  precise behavior documented and remembered. Michael Nielsen gives
  the example of memorizing specific reasons he doesn't want to
  collaborate with certain people.

* I want it to be the case that people can hold more ideas in their
  head at once, and for there to be more "serendipitous" discoveries.
  But I'm not actually confident this will be the case, seeing that
  people don't even have basic traits of competence (like searching a
  forum before asking a question).

* For social scientists: given access to people's SRS decks, it would
  be possible to tell what really matters to people, for the long
  term.

Things that might prima facie seem to improve but where I don't expect
improvements:

* Compared to before the arrival of smartphones, something like the
  ability of remember facts that can be looked up quickly, or
  remembering phone numbers, addresses, driving directions, isn't as
  important.

* Remembering the physical location of objects. (e.g. where are the
  car keys?). I think this sort of spacial information of things that
  change frequently are hard to describe and put into SRS.
