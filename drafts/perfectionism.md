- programming: "over-engineering" something; and of course Facebook's famous
  "move fast and break things; if you're not breaking things you're not moving
  fast enough" etc. (though Zuckerberg has shifted Facebook away from that

- 80-20 rule
- semantic web; impatience
- same with semantic web: the market won’t accept it because people don’t wanna put in the work
