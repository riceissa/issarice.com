Similarly to sites like
[reddit](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Using_reddit), Quora, and
4chan, 2channel mostly consists of attention-grabbing but useless
content.  Here I want to collect the exceptions to this rule, i.e. 2ch
threads that are actually informative.

- [大学を卒業するまでに社会へ出なくていい方法を見つけたい](http://hello.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/campus/1439801445/)
- [本の組版やフォントについて語るスレ](http://book3.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/books/1091743113/)
- There used to be an active site called [2ちゃんねるベストヒット](http://yet.s61.xrea.com/mt/).
