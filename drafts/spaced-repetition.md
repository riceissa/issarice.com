some notes on spaced repetition.

# brief timeline of my usage

* first heard about anki/spaced repetition sometime in 2011-2013, and used it to memorize pretty random things
* stopped using it around 2014
* started using it again in mid-2018, mainly on math

# parallel reading

something i like about anki is that as long as i remember these
definitions, then i can take an arbitrary break from reading a book or
paper, and can return to it again when i get excited. so it allows for
"parallel reading", which is something i like to do but i wasn't so
good at before (due to forgetting things).

# creating front and back side separately

as i'm reading something and come up with questions, those
questions can be the front side of an anki card. then if/when i find
the answer, i can make the card (with the answer as the back side).
the problem is that i need to write down or remember the questions i
have. so it's a two-stage process, whereas with making cards for
definitions, i can just do it as i read the textbook.

# upper bound on interval

something i haven't seen discussed by spaced repetition advocates
is how there might be a "limit" to how long you can remember
something. if spaced repetition unboundedly keeps increasing the
interval of review, you might forget things anyway, even with SRS. the
limit might be 10 years, say. so if once review interval goes past 10
years, you just forget it after 10 years. Anki has a deck setting
to adjust this value.

of course, if this biological limit is more like 60 years, then it's
not a problem, because i will likely be dead before my memories'
review interval crosses the limit.

another thing i haven't seen discussed is how old people have worse
memories. so an SRS should probably start _decreasing_ the
interval as the user gets older.
