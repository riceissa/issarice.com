some notes on spaced repetition.

# brief timeline of my usage

* first heard about anki/spaced repetition sometime in 2011-2013, and used it to memorize pretty random things
* stopped using it around 2014
* started using it again in mid-2018, mainly on math

# parallel reading

something i like about anki is that as long as i remember these
definitions, then i can take an arbitrary break from reading a book or
paper, and can return to it again when i get excited. so it allows for
"parallel reading", which is something i like to do but i wasn't so
good at before (due to forgetting things).

# learning things to use later

with spaced repetition it becomes possible to learn things just because
they seem interesting. without some sort of review mechanism, there is
the danger that one learns it "just because" but then forgets it soon
because it's not used for anything.

# creating front and back side separately

as i'm reading something and come up with questions, those
questions can be the front side of an anki card. then if/when i find
the answer, i can make the card (with the answer as the back side).
the problem is that i need to write down or remember the questions i
have. so it's a two-stage process, whereas with making cards for
definitions, i can just do it as i read the textbook.

# upper bound on interval

something i haven't seen discussed by spaced repetition advocates
is how there might be a "limit" to how long you can remember
something. if spaced repetition unboundedly keeps increasing the
interval of review, you might forget things anyway, even with SRS. the
limit might be 10 years, say. so if once review interval goes past 10
years, you just forget it after 10 years. Anki has a deck setting
to adjust this value.

of course, if this biological limit is more like 60 years, then it's
not a problem, because i will likely be dead before my memories'
review interval crosses the limit.

another thing i haven't seen discussed is how old people have worse
memories. so an SRS should probably start _decreasing_ the
interval as the user gets older.

# shifting interests over time

one danger with anki is that
the stuff i need to remember now has changed a lot compared to what i
was using anki for back in 2013 and 2014. This is possibly one reason
why i stopped using anki. (back then, i hadn't figured out how to use
it for math, other than memorizing integrals or trig identities or whatever.)
i memorized a lot of
things for classes, like literary techniques and spanish vocab. but
these things have become unimportant to me.

this also means that, if i want to keep using anki, i should liberally
delete (or suspend) cards from my deck if i no longer need them. the goal is to
keep using anki, and keeping bad cards makes that harder (because i'm
less excited).

# spaced repetition for problems

something i want
is this sort of problem solving review system, like anki. but instead
of these basic flash cards, i'm presented with a problem to solve. the
problem could be new, or it could be one i've seen before, or it could
be a variation on one i've seen before. and the idea is to keep me
sharp so i don't forget how to solve problems i've learned how to
solve.

maybe this sort of thing is possible using a separate anki deck with
custom spacing parameters. i think it would be annoying if i was asked
to solve the same problem 1 day later or 4 days later or whatever (at
the initial stages). so maybe the deck would be customized so that
even in the beginning ("learning stages" of the card) i would only be
shown the same problem after a week or more.

maybe the more important point is that i'd like this anki stuff
to be done automatically... i don't want to have to put in all this
effort to making my own cards, checking LaTeX formatting etc. etc. The
cards really should just be "created at the speed of thought".

# forgetting surrounding parts

one worry i have with anki
is that i will remember the specific question-answer pairs for a long
time, but that as time goes on, i will remember _only_ those, and will
forget the general subject. so i might remember the intuition behind
newton's approximation, but i won't know how to apply it or won't
remember that it's useful in proving the chain rule. it's hard to
detect the things i forget. and right now, if a subject is still fresh
in my mind, it's not obvious to me that i will forget these "filler"
parts of the subject (i.e. the parts that haven't been ankified).

Feynman says that one can ["triangulate"](https://www.quora.com/Do-grad-school-students-remember-everything-they-were-taught-in-college-all-the-time/answer/Mark-Eichenlaub)
as one gains expertise, to fill in the missing parts.
