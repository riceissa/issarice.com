- givewell's domain used to be `givewell.net` so you will find some older
  versions of the website there.

- registration stuff cf. https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Domain_names_in_timelines
  - twitter 23 Apr 2009 https://twitter.com/GiveWell (hover over "Joined April 2009")
  - `givewell.org` domain: note that the domain used to be controlled by a
    [GiveWell Foundation](https://web.archive.org/web/20020719202956/http://www.givewell.org:80/)
    so the [1991 registration date](https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=givewell.org)
    isn't accurate. However you can use archive.org snapshots to find out when
    the switch happened.
  - `givewell.net` domain: [Creation Date: 2006-11-19T13:50:18Z](https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=givewell.net)
    sounds right to me.

  - HTTPS starting 2017-09-30 or 2017-10-01. Note that donations page was
