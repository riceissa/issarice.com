  - `givewell.org` domain: note that the domain used to be controlled by a
    [GiveWell Foundation](https://web.archive.org/web/20020719202956/http://www.givewell.org:80/)
    so the [1991 registration date](https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=givewell.org)
    isn't accurate.
  - `givewell.net` domain: [Creation Date: 2006-11-19T13:50:18Z](https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=givewell.net)
    sounds right to me.
