title: Page path prevalence
---

I'm curious about how people organize their websites.

let's narrow down to `*.wordpress.com/`, i.e. all wordpress blogs indexed by
google.

i am performing searches like `site:*.wordpress.com/about`

in the below table, `x` means searching for `site:*.wordpress.com/x`

all searches done through my own google account on 2017-08-21.

note that in some cases these will find *prefixes*, i.e. a search for path `x`
will find `xy`. however this is not always the case, e.g. the number of results
for `consulting` is greater than that for `consult`.

I did not set to "Search for English results only"
