title: Page path prevalence
---

I'm curious about how people organize their websites.

let's narrow down to `*.wordpress.com/`, i.e. all wordpress blogs indexed by
google.

i am performing searches like `site:*.wordpress.com/about`

in the below table, `x` means searching for `site:*.wordpress.com/x`

all searches done through my own google account on 2017-08-21.

note that in some cases these will find *prefixes*, i.e. a search for path `x`
will find `xy`. however this is not always the case, e.g. the number of results
for `consulting` is greater than that for `consult`.

I did not set to "Search for English results only"

some of the popular paths are used for multiple purposes, so they don't
necessarily imply the popularity of a particular purpose.

the numbers are [*very rough estimates*](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+reliable+is+google+number+of+results)

see my [facebook
post](https://www.facebook.com/riceissa/posts/1969878083291139) for more
thinking along these lines.
