For creator:

I guess my view is biased in favor of what i currently do because i don't like talking to people and don't have access to a lot of people (and don't like touching people)

For world:

I think the marginal synthesis still seems more useful for the world than the marginal conversation notes (in person-hours). Having read a lot of conversation notes from GW, I think they are useful for the interviewer to get "unstuck" but for others to read they tend to be superficial (you can't talk about much in an hour), lacking in comprehensiveness (the "expert interviewee" typically just pulls stuff out of their heads), and also probably lacking a lot of novelty anyway (a lot of experts tend to repeat their findings everywhere)

However i do wonder if there can be some sort of idealized question asker
interviewer quality probably varies a lot, and someone very good at it could extract novel expert insights
juicy secrets and stuff could be left out. e.g. Luke's convo with drescher does not mention anything about his past blog posts (written seven years before the conversation!)
(about drescher's book)
