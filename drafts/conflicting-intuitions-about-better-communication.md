# Conflicting intuitions about better communication

Better communication, pedagogy, and so on allows people to learn more quickly
to make more progress on intellectual questions. The [argument
goes](http://lesswrong.com/lw/o5z/on_the_importance_of_less_wrong_or_another_single/)
that having a "single conversational locus" and shared background makes it
easier to build on previous conversations, there is less duplication of effort,
and so on.

But better communication also seems to lead to better propaganda and
brainwashing methods, more interconnectedness (hence, more monolithic
thinking), and so on. For instance Wei Dai [says](https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/xQ9tMMk3RArodLtDq/intellectual-progress-inside-and-outside-academia)
"If joining academia makes somebody much less able to recognize progress in
decision theory, that seems like a bad thing and we shouldn't be encouraging
people to do that".

Should we think of academia as one extreme, and informal discussion forums as
the other extreme, with intermediates/hybrids in between? Or should we think of
academia and informal discussion forums as just two possible institutions with
particular incentives, not necessarily extremes, and hope to construct other
institutions with different incentives to see what comes out of them?

This is one reason to be skeptical about lists of "five best books" and so
forth: they promote having the same background, with the same sets of biases,
priming people to look at things the same way, and so forth.
