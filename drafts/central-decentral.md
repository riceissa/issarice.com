Similarly, I have noticed a tendency for decentralized approaches to overtake
centralized ones. But I don't want to argue for the truth of this or argue for
it in general, but rather list a bunch of examples and look at the potential
for coherency.

For the proprietary/free software one: the distinction is not meant in regards
to the whole universe of software; if it were, then proprietary software can be
decentralized as well, since multiple individuals/firms can compete each with
their own software. Rather, the distinction is meant in the sense that with
proprietary software, one cannot fork without permission, so a single
authoritative entity pushes out new versions of a piece of software. With free
software, anyone can fork, so in principle there are no privileged nodes in
the "software tree of life".

I am not sure about the wealth equality one. It might just be that once
economic variable is fixed in favor of decentralization, the wealth variable
automatically resolves, so that there isn't an extra variable to fix (you would
be overspecifying the system).
