starting with patreon, which has a "writing" category: https://www.patreon.com/explore/writing

https://www.patreon.com/waitbutwhy "Our initial goal is $12,000/month." -- this
seems like a lot for the uses described, especially since urban himself seems
to require little money: "I need to continue to eat things and wear things and
turn lights on as I write and draw posts. I'm a guy with no kids in a tiny NY
one-bedroom apt though, so needs are minimal."

the improvements listed for meeting the stretch goal are: "Start a weekly
podcast", "Make (animated?) video version of posts", "Hire a second employee",
"Redo the website". i'm pretty skeptical that these things (except maybe hiring
another employee -- but you need to know what to do with the employee for it to
be worth hiring) are good uses of money. i wonder if there's really just a
limit on how much a single person can do with a website, especially once he is
bringing in $12k/month.

1,620 patrons but no amount per month listed. the site apparently [launched in
July 2016](http://mcmansionhell.com/about):

> Kate Wagner is the creator of the viral blog McMansionHell, which roasts the
> worldâ€™s ugliest houses from top to bottom, all while teaching about
> architecture and design. Since its launch in July 2016, the blog has been

the topic seems a little obscure, but i can see how it could become popular. is
there something special that wagner is doing?

[googling her

clear to me where she writes. [twitter](https://twitter.com/caitoz?lang=en)

links to the [medium](https://medium.com/@caityjohnstone) profile.

- are there any rationalist-adjacent people doing independent work? e.g. i
  think FRI researchers would be interesting to look at.
