From "[Those Whom The Gods Love Grow Young: Some Notes on Wilde, Greece & Youth](http://dmouth.com/writing/2014/4/12/those-whom-the-gods-love-grow-young-some-notes-on-wilde-greece-youth)":

> But when you subtract all of our warped assumption, youâ€™re left

> potentially at any age. Youth is a freshness and a beauty and form
> of strength that can be shared with another human in exchange for
> wisdom and strength of other varieties. We forget that a fifteen
> year old is as much a complete human as a fifty year old because
> society has been built in order to let the old dominate, exploit
> and indoctrinate the young according to the tenets of the child /
> adult dichotomy. But as a complete human, they deserve the same
> rights, respect and liberty to which anything born with humanity
