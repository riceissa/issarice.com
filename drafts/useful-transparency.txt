How can individuals make their transparency more useful to others?

See simulating-others.txt for some related discussion.

So I think to allow others to simulate you well, you need to give out both specific beliefs/assumptions, as well as a style of thinking

but if you look at my online activity, you could make out my thinking style: writing lots of notes, collecting things, organizing things into timelines etc

but I think I am less good about presenting more of my beliefs and assumptions than some others (e.g. Bryan Caplan). Partly, this is because I have fewer "solid beliefs" about the world. but also I like to present myself by laying down facts and so forth more than laying down beliefs and arguing for a specific position.

also I get very little feedback on my transparency -- mostly I reason about this in terms of what *I* would like to see in *others*, and then trying to do that myself. (And if I saw a young person giving their beliefs on various topics without also doing a lot of "fact-based work", I would be suspicious...)
