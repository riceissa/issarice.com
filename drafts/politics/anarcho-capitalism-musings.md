## Reductions

I've seen some libertarians object to anthropomorphizing organizations because
"it's the individuals within the organizations that matter". But couldn't this
apply just as well to argue for *further reductions in the same direction*? The
"individuals" that libertarians talk about are just collections of particles
governed by physical laws. Why be satisfied with reducing some levels of
abstraction but not bother with the others?

My point is not that one ought to *always* be dealing with how particles
interact using physical laws. Rather, certain abstractions are *useful* in
*modeling* things.

Here is Rothbard in *For a New Liberty*:

> We have talked at length of individual rights; but what, it may be asked, of
> the "rights of society"? Don't they supersede the rights of the mere
> individual? The libertarian, however, is an individualist; he believes that
> one of the prime errors in social theory is to treat "society" as if it were

## Scale

A lot of examples in anarcho-capitalist books are given in a small scale. For
instance, David Friedman in *The Machinery of Freedom* gives an example of a
world of 100 doctors and what happens if an additional doctor is added.
Friedman is careful to explicitly generalize ("If the total number of
physicians were much larger than one hundred (as it is) [...]"). And no doubt
starting with small examples that are easier to make sense of to build
intuition is pedagogically important. But I am still worried that some of these
examples that prove the viability of anarcho-capitalism might break down at
scales that are *really* huge. Friedman even says this about "love":

> Love---more generally, the sharing of a common end---works well, but only for
> a limited range of problems. It is difficult to know very many people well
> enough to love them. Love can provide cooperation on complicated things among
> very small groups of people, such as families. It also works among large
> numbers of people for very simple ends---ends so simple that many different
> people can completely agree on them. But for a complicated end involving a
> large number of people---producing this book, for instance---love will not
> work.

Do we have reason to believe that anarcho-capitalist ways of organizing society
don't similarly break down for sufficiently large scale?
