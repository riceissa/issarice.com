# Drafts folder

The drafts here are provided in the interest of greater transparency. However,
they are not guaranteed to be suitable for public consumption.

As with the `external` folder, the content here might eventually be hosted on a
website other than issarice.com. I keep stuff here because it's convenient to
have my notes in a single place, rather than scattered across a bunch of
repositories.
