Some unschooling resources:

- A [literature review](http://causeprioritization.org/Unschooling) I tried to conduct with a friend for a school project, part of which eventually made its way to the [Cause Prioritization Wiki](http://causeprioritization.org/) (which I started)
- The [Quora]() topic [Education Reform and Disruption](https://www.quora.com/Education-Reform-and-Disruption)
- [My answer](https://www.quora.com/What-would-Noam-Chomsky-think-of-unschooling/answer/Issa-Rice) to “What would Noam Chomsky think of unschooling?” on Quora
- [Cognito Mentoring info wiki](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/) (a resource
designed to help students who are intellectually curious but are
frustrated with traditional schooling), to which I occasionally contribute; you can view [my contributions to the wiki][cm cont].
