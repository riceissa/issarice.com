# why do i hate networking so much?

off the cuff, debugging-type thoughts.

* instead of providing partners with all information or all relevant
  information, you feed them with a sequence of pieces of information
  optimizing for the amount of money or other benefits they'll give you. For
  me, this breaks the principle of trying to help others as much as you can,
  and it builds a kind of adversarial mindset.

* scope insensitivity. why restrict yourself to a bunch of 1-to-1 communication
  channels rather than a bunch of 1-to-many channels, where you get to build a
  public repository of useful information?

* you have to remember a bunch of extra info like alliances, which pieces of
  info are secret from the public, and so forth.

* it breaks time- and resource-accountability (distinct from *responsibility*
  a.k.a. *accountability for consequences*, which is what people often mean by
  "accountability"). Time spent networking, which is a lot for some people, is
  time that is inherently opaque to public scrutiny. So it makes it harder for
  others to reason about.

* this one is incidental, but a lot of it happens in-person. And doing stuff
  IRL is inefficient, hard to convert to text, etc.

* contact surface with agents unknown to you. networking only provides a narrow
  channel to talk to the outside world. but by "thinking out loud to the
  world", you maximize the chances that an Issa\_2013 reads what you think.
