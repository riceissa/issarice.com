as a way to find contract workers. for $3,900 (plus lost hours of work), how many hours of solid contract work would be required to offset the cost of the workshop? (idk)

even cfar itself does this, where it finds new instructors and mentors/TAs via its workshops.

spending four days with potential workers to better tap into their psyches. (lol)

good way to impress potential workers with your charisma in order to convince them to work for you -- they are already inclined toward the "do-gooding" that CFAR is supposedly pushing for, anyway.

less inferential distance to bridge, as people will be familiar with EA/rationality ideas.
