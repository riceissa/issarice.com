This might sound loony, but I think that viewed in a certain sense,
UDT is the formalization of the karma/veil of ignorance/"God is
watching me" intuition that many people have. (Gary Drescher
talks about the middle one a bit in his book _Good and Real_.)

For "God is watching me", see some of Joe Henrich's papers, e.g.
["Moralistic gods, supernatural punishment and the expansion of
human sociality"](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16980):

> Here we focus on one key hypothesis: cognitive representations of gods as
> increasingly knowledgeable and punitive, and who sanction violators of
> interpersonal social norms, foster and sustain the expansion of cooperation,
> trust and fairness towards co-religionist strangers

and ["Outsourcing punishment to God: beliefs in
divine control reduce earthly punishment"](https://coevolution.fas.harvard.edu/files/culture_cognition_coevol_lab/files/laurin_shariff_henrich_kay_2012.pdf):

> Evolutionary  approaches  to  religion  suggest  that  beliefs  in  powerful,
> moralizing Gods, who can distribute rewards and punishments, emerged as a way to augment earthly
> punishment in large societies that could not effectively monitor norm violations.

For karma, "Good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and future happiness,
while bad intent and bad deeds contribute to bad karma and future suffering."
(from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma))
But how does mere intent cause future outcomes? Through simulations of you in the minds
of predictors!
