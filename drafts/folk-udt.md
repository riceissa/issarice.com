This might sound loony, but I think that viewed in a certain sense,
UDT is the formalization of the veil of ignorance/"God is
watching me"/karma intuition that many people have.
What do I mean by this? Maybe something like "A person making
decisions under the assumption that God is watching them acts more
like a UDT agent than like a CDT agent."

Gary Drescher talks about the veil of ignorance a bit in his book _Good and Real_;

on this.

For "God is watching me", see some of Joe Henrich's papers, e.g.
["Moralistic gods, supernatural punishment and the expansion of
human sociality"](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16980):

> Here we focus on one key hypothesis: cognitive representations of gods as
> increasingly knowledgeable and punitive, and who sanction violators of
> interpersonal social norms, foster and sustain the expansion of cooperation,
> trust and fairness towards co-religionist strangers

and ["Outsourcing punishment to God: beliefs in
divine control reduce earthly punishment"](https://coevolution.fas.harvard.edu/files/culture_cognition_coevol_lab/files/laurin_shariff_henrich_kay_2012.pdf):

> Evolutionary approaches to religion suggest that beliefs in powerful,
> moralizing Gods, who can distribute rewards and punishments, emerged as a way to augment earthly
> punishment in large societies that could not effectively monitor norm violations.

For karma, "Good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and future happiness,
while bad intent and bad deeds contribute to bad karma and future suffering."
(from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma))
But how does mere intent cause future outcomes? Through simulations of you in the minds
of predictors!

I am not suggesting that karma/"God is watching" me are useful concepts to work with,
once one already has UDT. But I do think the connection is interesting.
Actually, before UDT, one might have rightly used some sort of Chesterton's fence-type
argument in favor of these intuitions (instead of just using something like CDT).
