I decided to spend some time looking through /r/DataHoarder, a subreddit.
I did this as part of my interest in [digital preservation]().

Looking through the [top posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/top/?sort=top&t=all),
I noticed that most of them were about people showing off the arrivals
of their new high-capacity storage drives.
There are also some posts that show off people's specs through a software
dashboard.
I wasn't too interested in this, but this seems to by typical of reddit,
where simple feel-good posts get the highest scores.

It's actually a little surprising to me how much the hardware aspects
of data hoarding/archiving dominate the top posts on this subreddit.
Other aspects hint toward this interest in hardware as well, like the
flares for the subreddit being one's storage capacity.
However, it does look like there are subreddits like /r/OpenDirectories
and /r/DHExchange that focus exclusively on the content side.
