facebook profile seems to be https://www.facebook.com/gary.drescher (based on
mutual friends, this seems to be the one). However, somewhat worrying is that
his public posts mostly seem to be about politics -- protests, free speech,
Donald Trump, Charlie Hebdo, and so on.

As far as I can make out, he doesn't have much of an online presence beyond
this.

From [wikipedia talk page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gary_Drescher),
an IP comments:

[on marvin minsky's website, drescher is listed](http://web.media.mit.edu/%7Eminsky/people.html).
The link from his name goes to <http://www.think.com/>.
Drescher has a star next to his name, and at the top it says
"Asterisks are Amazon.com bookstore entries."
However, since the link doesn't go to an Amazon page, I think it just means
that Drescher was working for TMC at some point.

"Gary L. Drescher is a Scientist with Thinking Machines Corporation."
