Thoughts on a general epistemic disclaimer

In private settings people are generally more lax about their epistemic
standards, and are also willing to share more. Is there some way to get people
to share more in public, even if their thoughts are less epistemically careful?
One idea is to slap on a "general epistemic disclaimer" to a subset of public
output, something meaning "this isn't something I would normally make public,
but I am posting it anyway because I want to see more public discourse". A kind
of inverted Crocker's rule, so instead of "Feel free to criticize this
candidly" it is "Please be especially charitable to me".

Some academics already do this when they slap on statements like "please don't
quote from this draft without permission". And ad hoc epistemic disclaimers at
the top of blog posts are becoming more common in the rationalist sphere.

This seems like a bad idea if it is abused so that people use it on almost
anything, and use it as an excuse to e.g. advocate extreme actions.
