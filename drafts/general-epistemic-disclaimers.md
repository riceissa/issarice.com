Thoughts on a general epistemic disclaimer

In private settings people are generally more lax about their epistemic
standards, and are also willing to share more. Is there some way to get people
to share more in public, even if their thoughts are less epistemically careful?
One idea is to slap on a "general epistemic disclaimer" to a subset of public
output, something meaning "this isn't something I would normally make public,
but I am posting it anyway because I want to see more public discourse". A kind
of inverted Crocker's rule, so instead of "Feel free to criticize this
candidly" it is "Please be especially charitable to me".

Some academics already do this when they slap on statements like "please don't
quote from this draft without permission". And ad hoc epistemic disclaimers at
the top of blog posts are becoming more common in the rationalist sphere.

This seems like a bad idea if it is abused so that people use it on almost
anything, and use it as an excuse to e.g. advocate extreme actions.

Thoughts about hedges. Where should we attach our hedges? People
in the rationality sphere have slowly begun attaching "epistemic
status" disclaimers at the top of their blog/Facebook posts. But
is this a good idea, relative to attaching usual hedges at the
relevant locations (e.g. as part of each sentence, or at the
beginning of a paragraph to mark it as "more uncertain", for
instance)? This is not clear to me. Arbital also has confidence
distribution graphs that one can attach to statements, but doing
this for each statement seems excessive.

Another related idea is that people have different ways in which
they like to write, such that it really just *doesn't* make sense
to evaluate them all in the same way. Some people like to think
about a topic for years, having informal conversations with
others, and only after a lot of "battery/stress tests" and so
forth have been applied to an idea do they sit down and take the
time to write it all out. Other people (including myself) like to
"think onto paper", and to write down one *strand of thought* that
seems interesting in the moment, *without making any claims about
its performance on various stress tests*. The idea is to try to
come up with interesting ideas, and hopefully some of them will
turn out to be true and important. The closest analogy my tired
mind can come up with is like trying to
maintain a "portfolio of ideas", where one does not make claims
(at least at the start) that any of them will turn out to be true or
important or significant; rather, one pursues these ideas in the
hopes that *some* of them will turn out to have such properties.

The problem I see, then, is that it's often not easy to
distinguish these two types of writings. Some people, like Holden
Karnofsky circa 2007, have a writing style that ["tended toward
hyperbole rather than careful statement of the strength of my
views"](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/17o/some_thoughts_on_public_discourse/)
in a way that is somewhat obvious for outsiders to figure out. But
in the case of others, it is genuinely difficult to discern exactly how
much they buy into their own current statements. This makes it pretty
difficult to build a model of someone! (It makes it time-consuming,
because you have to get to know them well, have extended conversations,
and so forth.)
