> Frequently imagine what someone you respect, thinking you were wrong, would say/try to make the best argument against what you are currently thinking.

Vipul Naik:

> How would the sequence of actions look if one stepped back from the situation? How would my actions look to my future self? How would they look to my past self? How would they look to somebody who was far less privileged than I was, observing me? How would they look to a hypothetical God, if he/she existed? How would they look to somebody who held me in high esteem (a friend, mentor, mentee, or business associate)? How would they look to a person who mistrusted or disliked me and was looking for material to prove the point?

CFAR also teaches a technique called "Inner Simulator":

> Each of us carries a rich, vibrant model of the universe in our heads, giving us access to quick, gut-level predictions ranging from where a flying ball will land to how a peer will react to a given sentence or tone of voice. Our first lesson outlines the strengths and weaknesses of participants’ inner simulators, and provides models for when and how to use them (versus when to be suspicious of them).

> To take a more prosaic example, a person might realize that humans tend to be alike: Even without knowing about specific trading partners, they know there there exist other people with similar situations, goals, desires, challenges, resource constraints, and mental architectures.

> Even we humans simulate each other's thoughts to guess what the other would do.

"The most unusual technique I use to get faster feedback in a variety of domains is simply simulating things in my head. For example, I'll spend a lot of time simulating a presentation before actually giving it, and the imagined feedback lets me make many improvements before the real thing."

https://www.readthesequences.com/Humans-In-Funny-Suits talks about this, for example:

> The only reason you can try at all to grasp anything as physically complex and poorly understood as the brain of another human being is that you configure your own brain to imitate it. You empathize (though perhaps not sympathize). You impose on your own brain the shadow of the other mind’s anger and the shadow of its beliefs. You may never think the words, “What would I do in this situation?,” but that little shadow of the other mind that you hold within yourself is something animated within your own brain, invoking the same complex machinery that exists in the other person, synchronizing gears you don’t understand.
