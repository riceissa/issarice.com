At some point in the future I want to elaborate on some parts of this song.  It would be nice to analyze Swift at length as well (e.g. What draws people to her?
How does she compare to other female singers like Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, and Avril Lavigne?).

Some points I want to make later (when I have more time):

- Note the difference between this song and standard "Dear John" letters that wives send out.
- Look at the song alongside "Hey Stephen", perhaps ...
