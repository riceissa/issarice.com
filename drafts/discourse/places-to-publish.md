something i have wondered about is how to decide when and where to publish
things i write or make. there is my website, of course, but i've been thinking
of it these days as more of a place for biographical information rather than a
full-featured publication venue.

- a facebook messenger chat (but i will need to choose *which* chat)
- a page on my website, under `wiki/`
- in the drafts folder in my website repo (but i will need to choose where in
  the folder)
- timelines wiki (if a timeline)
- lesswrong (which i reserve for more important/large posts)
- EA forum (which again i reserve for larger things)
- as a TODO entry in my org-mode file
- a facebook post (which i don't like doing)
- a quora question or answer
- various other subject-specific websites/wikis

This decision has to be made in a few seconds if i want to begin writing
immediately, and changing my mind has some costs (like having to translate
markup). there are also some public discourse implications. e.g. writing
thoughts in messenger has low risk of embarrassment, feedback within the hour
(when someone replies), a norm that not bothering with formatting is fine (e.g.
capitalization isn't important), and once sent it is not something i have the
urge to perfect. This makes it satisfying to write for, and seems great if not
for the fact that it means a lot of things remain private and disorganized.
copying chunks of text out of a message history is possible, but i have rarely
done this.

even when i am writing, say, a quick script, do i choose a gist or a full
github repo? maybe a rule like "if it's more than copy-pasting the output of a
program to share, use a full repo" could work.

there is also the "blog vs wiki" question. i generally lean strongly toward the
wiki style of writing, but maybe i ought to keep a blog around to record
snapshots of thoughts (that become difficult to find and lose authenticity as
historical records as a wiki page gets edited). For instance, do i want to know
what i thought about website making in 2014, or do i want to keep my best
understanding visible? it seems like both are useful but served by different
publishing methods.
