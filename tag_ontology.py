# List of tag implications to be used with imply_tags.  Below, (a, [b])
# means that the tag a implies tag b; so if you have a page with tag a,
# it will automatically also be applied the tag b.  Note that the order
# here is important.  Let's say we also have
#    (b, [c])
# then doing tag a should also imply tag c, since the implication chain
# goes a -> b -> c.  In other words, tag implication should be
# transitive, in that a -> b and b -> c together mean a -> c.  This
# means though that you should put (a, [b]) before (b, [c]), since then
# the first will be applied, leaving you with the tags a and b, and then
# the second will be applied, leaving you with tags a, b, and c. (This
# is an OrderedDict so that the above works.)  It is also assumed here
# that everything in tag_implications is standardized.
