<h1>Portfolio of Issa Rice</h1>

<p>This page showcases the work I have done, in portfolio format. This page is organized into two sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#projects">Projects</a>&nbsp;&ndash; this section lists some of the biggest projects I've worked on over the past few years</li>
  <li><a href="#interests-focus-areas">Interests/focus areas</a>&nbsp;&ndash; this section groups my work by "interests" or "focus areas"; it re-lists my major projects and also includes my smaller work</li>
</ul>

<p>See my <a href="https://issarice.com/work">work page</a> or my <a href="https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Issa+Rice">contract work profile on Vipul Naik's website</a> for a more complete listing of my work.</p>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

<p>This section lists some of the major project I have worked on.</p>

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">
    <h3 id="ai-watch"><a href="https://aiwatch.issarice.com/">AI Watch</a></h3>
    <p>AI Watch is a website to track the technical agendas, people,
    organizations, products, and other aspects in the field of AI safety and alignment.</p>
    <p>I decided to create AI Watch for several reasons:
    (1) I kept hearing people say things like "depending on how your count,
    there are only around 60 AI safety researchers in the world" without
    an accompanying list of such people&nbsp;&ndash; if there were so few researchers,
    it shouldn't be difficult to make such a list!
    (2) I was trying to decide if I should work on AI safety,
    and one input to my decision was to get a fine-grained understanding of
    the landscape of the field&nbsp;&ndash; all the people working in it,
    the organizations, the number of people trying to enter the field,
    and so forth.
    (3) Based on the popularity of the annual AI safety literature review
    by Ben Henry (<a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/14w/2017_ai_risk_literature_review_and_charity/">2016</a>,
    <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1iu/2018_ai_safety_literature_review_and_charity/">2017</a>,
    <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a72owS5hz3acBK5xc/2018-ai-alignment-literature-review-and-charity-comparison">2018</a>)
    and a blog post on <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/16s/changes_in_funding_in_the_ai_safety_field/">funding in AI safety</a> by Sebastian Farquhar,
    I thought there was demand for tracking the state of the field.</p>

    </figure>
  </div>
  <div class="grid-item">
    <h3 id="dlw"><a href="https://donations.vipulnaik.com/">Donations List Website (DLW)</a></h3>
    <p>A website created by <a href="https://vipulnaik.com/">Vipul Naik</a> to track foundation giving as well as
    personal donations (mostly by people associated with the effective altruism
    movement). I don't host the website, but I've done a lot of development
    work on the site, including <a
    href="https://github.com/topics/donations-list-website">scraping and
    processing grants data</a> and adding new features to the site. I am also the author of the <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/A7NWTjnWZPmjyLdtT/donations-list-website-tutorial-and-request-for-feedback">tutorial</a> for the site, which explains the basic features.</p>
    <p>Do you remember the bad old days when effective altruists would post
    their donation decisions and amounts on their personal blogs or on
    Effective Altruism Forum, and there was no central repository of this
    information? Thanks to DLW, finding and analyzing personal donations data
    has become a lot simpler.</p>

  <div class="grid-item">
    <h3 id="org-watch"><a href="https://orgwatch.issarice.com/">Org Watch</a></h3>
    <p>A generalization of AI Watch to organizations outside of AI safety. Even
    though Org Watch uses the same database and website code as AI Watch, it
    has different motivations (observe that none of the motivations I listed
    for AI Watch carry over to a generalization of it outside of AI
    safety): the idea is to try to understand an organization's trajectory by
    looking at its growth, changes in direction, external commentary, and so
    forth. By collecting all of this information in a single place, Org Watch
    hopes to be a useful resource for (1) those who are interested in an
    organization's work, and (2) those who are interested in working at an
    organization.</p>

      <figcaption>Organization documents track information about experience working at or applying for an organization, as well as hiring information. Organization documents are one of the features that were added to deal with the more organizational focus of Org Watch.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <div class="grid-item">
    <h3 id="cause-prioritization-wiki"><a href="https://causeprioritization.org/">Cause Prioritization Wiki</a></h3>
    <p>A wiki that I started which collects information about cause
    prioritization. I started this project as a college freshman, with guidance
    from <a href="https://vipulnaik.com/">Vipul Naik</a>. The premise of the
    wiki was that since there are some organizations doing in-house cause
    prioritization work without publishing much of it, there would be a lot of
    value in a group of people doing the same kind of work in public, making
    all of the reasoning transparent.</p>
    <p>It turns out that finding contributors who are willing to put in a lot
    of work is difficult, and my own time was split between several projects
    (and, when I originally started the wiki, school), so the wiki has not made
    as much progress as I would have liked at the start.</p>
    <figure>
      <a href="https://causeprioritization.org/dagitty-model.svg"><img src="cause-area-dag.png" height="300px"/></a>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <div class="grid-item">
    <h3 id="timelines-wiki"><a href="https://timelines.issarice.com/">Timelines Wiki</a></h3>
    <p>A wiki I host that serves timelines on various topics (EA and rationality, global health, tech startups, etc.). Note that I've only written a small fraction of the timelines on the site (I think a majority of the timelines have been written by <a href="https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Sebastian+Sanchez">Sebastian Sanchez</a>).<p>
    <p>Why focus on timelines? I think writing a timeline is a good first step
    in trying to understand a topic, because you don't need to read things
    chronologically (but the output will still be chronological). So you can go
    in confused about a topic and slowly get to build a good history of it,
    piece by piece. It's a way of doing "due diligence" on a topic. I think
    many people try to understand a topic without even doing anything
    comparable to writing a timeline, i.e. they just dive in and they don't even
    know the basic events that have happened for that topic, which leaves them
    confused.</p>
    <p>I have also found timelines useful for answering questions. For example,
    I <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/b6AB7LhSG5krtKEje/was-cfar-always-intended-to-be-a-distinct-organization-from#cYyXLADw8XB8zsRsk">answered</a>
    a question about the history of the Center for Applied Rationality (CFAR) by
    using the timeline of it that I had already written, plus some internet
    searches.</p>

    <p>Since 2019 I have been suffering from a mysterious chronic illness
    (probably some kind of autoimmune or pre-autoimmune disease or some sort of
    other immune disorder).
    Naturally, I've done a bunch of reading about this and have even written a
    few things.</p>

        together everything I have learned about shortness of breath or “air
        hunger”. For the moment it’s half-guidebook and half-research notebook,
        but eventually I am hoping to turn it into a complete guide on curing
        the kind of shortness of breath that does not show up on standard
        medical testing.</li>

    <p>I am interested in optimizing my learning (at the moment, this means

    <h3 id="global-health">Global health and poverty</h3>
    <p>Some of my work for <a href="https://vipulnaik.com/">Vipul Naik</a> has involved learning about global health and poverty, and I've written several Wikipedia pages about topics in global health. This is not an active interest these days.</p>
    <p>I have to admit I found working on global health somewhat emotionally challenging because I was never a "true believer" of it. I had always thought existential risk reduction to be a more important way to improve the world, so working on global health and poverty felt quite demotivating at times (but the general nature of doing research and writing was still enjoyable). Why did I work on it if I didn't believe in it? It was a combination of (1) wanting to get research experience, (2) wanting to work with Vipul, and (3) wanting to build up a financial savings buffer.</p>

    <h3 id="other">Other interests</h3>
    <p>I'm also interested in many other things that are kind of broad/vague and where I
    haven't done any concrete work in. Examples: understanding <a href="/people">people</a> and how
    they make decisions (sales and signaling, how people make life decisions,
    how people make and maintain friends), finding smart people and
    communities, philosophy (metaethics, what to value, consciousness, decision theory),
    evolutionary psychology, coordination and group decision making.</p>
    <p>You can find some of my project ideas in my <a href="https://github.com/riceissa/project-ideas">project ideas repository</a>.</p>
