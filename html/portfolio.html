<p>This page showcases the work I have done. This page is organized into two sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#projects">Projects</a>&nbsp;&ndash; this section lists some of the biggest projects I've worked on over the past few years</li>
  <li><a href="#interests-focus-areas">Interests/focus areas</a>&nbsp;&ndash; this section groups my work by "interests" or "focus areas"; it re-lists my major projects and also includes my smaller work</li>

    <h3><a href="https://aiwatch.issarice.com/">AI Watch</a></h3>
    <p>AI Watch is a website to track the technical agendas, people,
    organizations, products, and other aspects of AI safety/alignment.</p>
    <p>I decided to create AI Watch for several reasons: (1) I kept hearing people say things like "depending on how your count, there are only around 60 AI safety researchers in the world" without an accompanying list of such people&nbsp;&ndash; if there were so few researchers, it shouldn't be difficult to make such a list! (2) I was trying to decide if I should work on AI safety, and one input to my decision was to get a fine-grained understanding of the landscape of the field&nbsp;&ndash; all the people working in it, the organizations, the number of people trying to enter the field, and so forth. (3) based on things like the annual AI safety review, I thought there was demand for tracking the state of the field.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://donations.vipulnaik.com/">Donations List Website (DLW)</a></h3>
    <p>A website created by <a href="https://vipulnaik.com/">Vipul Naik</a> to track foundation giving as well as
    personal donations (mostly by people associated with the effective altruism
    movement). I don't host the website, but I've done a lot of development
    work on the site, including <a
    href="https://github.com/topics/donations-list-website">scraping and
    processing grants data</a> and adding new features to the site. I am also the author of the <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/A7NWTjnWZPmjyLdtT/donations-list-website-tutorial-and-request-for-feedback">tutorial</a> for the site, which explains the basic features.</p>
    <p>Do you remember the bad old days when effective altruists would post their donation decisions and amounts on their personal blogs or on Effective Altruism Forum, and there was no central repository of this information?</p>

    <h3><a href="https://orgwatch.issarice.com/">Org Watch</a></h3>
    <p>A generalization of AI Watch to organizations outside of AI safety. Even though Org Watch uses the same database and website code as AI Watch, it has different motivations (observe that none of the motivations I listed for AI Watch carry over to a generalization of it outside of AI safety).</p>

    <h3><a href="https://causeprioritization.org/">Cause Prioritization Wiki</a></h3>
    <p>A wiki that I started which collects information about cause prioritization. I started this project as a college freshman, with guidance from <a href="https://vipulnaik.com/">Vipul Naik</a>.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://timelines.issarice.com/">Timelines Wiki</a></h3>
    <p>A wiki I host that serves timelines on various topics (EA and rationality, global health, tech startups, etc.). Note that I've only written a small fraction of the timelines on the site.<p>
    <p>Why focus on timelines? I think writing a timeline is a good first step
    in trying to understand a topic, because you don't need to read things
    chronologically (but the output will still be chronological). So you can go
    in confused about a topic and slowly get to build a good history of it,
    piece by piece. It's a way of doing "due diligence" on a topic. I think
    many people try to understand a topic without even doing anything
    comparable to writing a timeline, i.e. they just dive in and they don't even
    know the basic events that have happened for that topic, which leaves them
    confused.</p>
    <p>I have also found timelines useful for answering questions. For example,
    I <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/b6AB7LhSG5krtKEje/was-cfar-always-intended-to-be-a-distinct-organization-from#cYyXLADw8XB8zsRsk">answered</a>
    a question about the history of the Center for Applied Rationality (CFAR) by
    using the timeline of it that I had already written, plus some internet
    searches.</p>

    <p>As I learn math, I sometimes write up notes about what I'm learning.

    <h3>Learning</h3>
    <p>I am interested in optimizing my learning (at the moment, this means
    figuring out how to self-study math better). Even though I enjoy learning, I hate
    school (even though I do well in school) and prefer to learn "at my own pace" (for more, see my <a href="https://issarice.com/university-of-washington">UW course reviews</a>, and my Quora reviews of <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-review-of-Inglemoor-High-School/answer/Issa-Rice">high school</a> and <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-review-of-Northshore-Junior-High-School/answer/Issa-Rice">junior high</a>).</p>

    <h3>Global health and poverty</h3>
    <p>Some of my work for <a href="https://vipulnaik.com/">Vipul Naik</a> has involved learning about global health and poverty, and I've written several Wikipedia pages about topics in global health. This is not an active interest these days.</p>
    <p>I have to admit I found working on global health somewhat emotionally challenging because I was never a "true believer" of it. I had always thought existential risk reduction to be a more important way to improve the world, so working on global health and poverty felt quite demotivating at times (but the general nature of doing research and writing was still enjoyable). Why did I work on it if I didn't believe in it? It was a combination of (1) wanting to get research experience, (2) wanting to work with Vipul, and (3) wanting to build up a savings buffer.</p>

    <h3>Other interests</h3>
    <p>I'm also interested in many other things that are kind of broad/vague and where I
    haven't done any concrete work in. Examples: understanding people and how
    they make decisions (sales and signaling, how people make life decisions,
    how people make and maintain friends), finding smart people and
    communities, philosophy (metaethics, what to value, consciousness),
    evolutionary psychology, coordination and group decision making.</p>
    <p>You can find some of my project ideas in my <a href="https://github.com/riceissa/project-ideas">project ideas repository</a>.</p>
