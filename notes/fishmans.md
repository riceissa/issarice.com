I think it's rare for me to like an artist so much, and hasn't really happened for any Japanese band (indeed, I don't know many Japanese bands I like at all, but that's mostly a fault of my lack of exploration).
I like this review of *空中キャンプ* a lot: [フィッシュマンズ『空中キャンプ』 - 音楽だいすきクラブ](http://ongakudaisukiclub.hateblo.jp/entry/2014/04/13/183000).
Indeed, when one starts thinking of "日常の「無意味さ」", it does become apparent that Fishmans has quite a lot in common with the novels of Murakami, although it's not clear to me why Murakami is much more popular in Japan and the rest of the world than, say, Fishmans.
In terms of the expression of this emotion, I don't think Fishmans is any worse.
There might be the point that Fishmans tends to leave things rather vague, whereas Murakami definitely describes a lot of interactions (especially those relating to sex and relationships) in detail.
But accomplishing this in lyric form seems especially difficult.

One thing I've always noticed peculiar are the *characters* that keep appearing in Fishmans lyrics.
Bob Dylan too notably introduces many characters in each of his songs (just listen to "Visions of Johanna" or "Bob Dylan's 115th Dream", to give two examples).
