Ever since Paul Graham's "[Keep Your Identity Small](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html)" was published, there seem to have been quite a few response posts published in various places.
I want to catalog some of those while also thinking about my own identity.

- "[Strategic choice of identity](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jsh/strategic_choice_of_identity/)"
- "[Use Your Identity Carefully](http://lesswrong.com/lw/idj/use_your_identity_carefully/)"
- "[Prickles and Goo](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/prickles-and-goo/)"
- [How committed are you?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8PsX0D6Zrc)---the commitment effect
