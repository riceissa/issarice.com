Despite mathematicians' apparent focus on notation, I've always found it difficult to navigate certain notation in math.

Part of the problem is that there is a lot in notation that is *implicit*.
When talking about mathematics in person, there is no need to specify all the context, because if anything is unclear, one can just ask and it will be clarified verbally.
